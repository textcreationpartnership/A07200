            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing vpon occaſion hertofore looked ſomewhat into the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; properties of a religious Faſt, I found it ſo pleaſing to God and ſo profitable for men, that I was thereupon induced not onely to make vſe of it in mine owne practice, but to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend it alſo in the exerciſe of my Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to my Hearers and Pariſhioners. And for the ſame reaſon, I haue now aduentured to offer my Meditations on this ſubiect to the <pb facs="tcp:21717:3"/>view of the world abroad; hoping that ſome may be occaſioned hereby to make a better vſe of this holy diſcipline, then of late yeeres men haue bin accuſtomed to doe. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer I haue incurred ſome mens cenſures already, by ſpeaking mine opinion, and ſhall now in all likelihood, by printing it, incurre the cenſures of other moe, eſpecially of ſuch forward ſpirits, as vſe to condemne before they conſider; yet I hope I ſhall be able to approue my Concluſions to the moderate &amp; iudicious Readers. For (if I doe not much miſtake my ſelfe; and if I erre, I deſire to bee directed better:) I haue on my ſide firſt of all the holy and bleſſed Scripture, the ſupreme Iudge of Controuerſies, againſt whoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence there can lye no exception or appeale. Secondly, I haue alſo the conſtant and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme conſent of learned Fathers, and of the Primitiue and ancient Church, whoſe vnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous iudgement all ſober men will ſo farre reſpect, as not to ſwarue from it, vnleſſe they can cleerely proue that it ſwarueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods Word. And laſtly, I haue alſo the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this preſent Church of
<hi>England;</hi> whom <pb facs="tcp:21717:3"/>her owne children may not lightly eſteeme, without contempt offered to their heauenly Father: and I for my part, do ſo much reſpect and reuerence, that beſides the Obſeruance, which is due to her as my Mother, I am alſo perſwaded in my ſoule, that ſhe is the pureſt &amp; beſt reformed Church in <hi>Europe;</hi> &amp; doe bleſſe God vpon my knees, that hath appointed her to be my Mother, &amp; my ſelfe to be bred and brought vp in her lapp. In which perſwaſion, beſide the maine reaſons or grounds of my beliefe, not now to be inſiſted vpon, I am the rather confirmed alſo, becauſe I know it was the conſtant opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Father, my much reuerenced Lord: whoſe iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t I do highly &amp; deſeruedly eſteeme; &amp; whoſe memory I ſhal euer deſire to honor with all dutifull and thankfull reſpect. And were he now aliue, I ſhould not ſeeke a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone for this little Booke elſewhere. But ſince that GOD hath tranſlated him from vs into the company of the glorified Saints; as I could not diuert my thoughts altogether fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, but ſhould rather haue offered this poore ſeruice to his Aſhes, then not to haue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <pb facs="tcp:21717:4"/>my reſpectiue dutie to his name: ſo I could not find any better reſemblance of him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, in which I might ſee him pourtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and in ſome ſort made preſent to mee, then in your ſelfe, who being his firſt-borne, doe beare a liuely image both of his perſon and vertues.

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are but two wayes to pleaſe God, and by pleaſing him, to come to eternall life; eyther perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods Lawe, or vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned repentance for our ſinnes. By the firſt way, <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency might haue obtained happineſſe: but ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, there is no way left but the ſecond. For <hi>all haue ſinned, and are depriued of the glory of God.</hi> And now the Scriptures doe preſſe Repentance the fore-runner of pardon, as that without which we <pb n="2" facs="tcp:21717:5"/>cannot be eyther freed from ſinne, or receyued to Gods fauour. And this is the cauſe, that Gods children haue ſo vſually accuſtomed themſelues to all meanes of humiliation, by which they might eyther encreaſe or expreſſe their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and godly ſorrow. Amongſt which meanes they found none more effectuall (and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them we finde none to haue beene more vſuall) then abſtinence and faſting. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whereof, together with the condition of our times, hath prouoked mee to looke into the nature of this thing, which eyther was too much vſed in former times, or elſe is a great deale too much neglected in ours. And that I might haue ſome directions to rule my meditations by, I thought it conuenient to take for my ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, the words of the Euangeliſt, where hee ſaith of our bleſſed Sauiour;
<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 4.2.</note> 
               <hi>And when he had faſted forty dayes and forty nights, hee was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an hungred.</hi> In which words there are three things ſpecified: firſt, what our Sauiour did,
<hi>he faſted:</hi> ſecondly, how long hee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herein, <hi>forty dayes, and forty nights:</hi> thirdly, what befell him in the end, <hi>hee was afterward an hungred.</hi> And within the compaſſe of theſe three things, I ſhall (God willing) bound and comprize my following meditations. In handling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I thinke it not amiſſe to preſcribe to my ſelfe this method. Firſt, to ſpeake of faſting in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and as it is conſidered by it ſelfe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to conſider it as it was heere practized by our Sauiour. And laſtly, to adde a few words of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:21717:5"/>our Sauiours hungring, which is the conſequent of his abſtinence and faſting.</p>
            <p>And firſt, for faſting in generall, there are theſe things to be conſidered:</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>What faſting is, and what this word doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>What ſorts of faſting are commended to vs in Scriptures for our vſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>How and wherein it may further vs for holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and workes of Gods ſeruice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>What conditions are required in our faſting, that it may be accepted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>In what caſes, and for what purpoſes it may ſerue vs to obtaine help and fauour from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, for faſting, as it was exerciſed by our Sauiour, wee haue theſe poynts to conſider of:</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Why our Lord did faſt at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Why he faſted forty dayes, and forty nights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>When, or at what times, men may or ought to faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>How long a Chriſtian ſhould continue his faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>What we are to thinke of that forty dayes faſt of Chriſtians, commonly called</hi> Ieiunium Quadrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimale, <hi>or Lent-Faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, with a briefe touch of Chriſts hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring, which is the third generall poynt, are the ſubiect and matter of the Diſcourſe following.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He moſt vſuall deſcription of Faſting is, that it is
<hi>an Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meat and drinke.</hi> And this deſcription is very agreeable to the manner of ſpeech, vſed by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which when they ſpeak of faſting, doe many times mention, and alwayes intend an abſtayning from food. As <hi>Eſter</hi> 4.16. <hi>Goe</hi> (ſaith
<hi>Eſter</hi>) <hi>gather together all the Iewes that are preſent in Shuſhan, and faſt yee for mee.</hi> But how ſhall this be done?

Let them not feede, nor drinke water.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> 5.33. <hi>Why doe the Diſciples of Iohn faſt often, &amp;c. but thine eate and drinke?</hi> Which ſpeech
<note n="a" place="margin">Mar. 2.18. Mat. 9.14.</note> other Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts doe expreſſe in theſe words: <hi>Why doe the Diſciples of Iohn, and of the Phariſes faſt, but thy Diſciples faſt not?</hi> Where wee may note, firſt that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> maketh an oppoſition between faſting, and eating or drinking. Secondly, That that which Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> calleth <hi>eating and drinking,</hi> the other Euangeliſts call <hi>not faſting.</hi> And by both theſe wee may gather, that faſting includeth an <pb n="5" facs="tcp:21717:6"/>abſtinence from meat and drinke. But thus farre the poynt is cleare. Onely a further queſtion may be asked, what kinde of abſtinence this is; whether totall and entier, from all meate and drinke, and from taſting of any thing, as the men of <hi>Nineueh</hi> and
<hi>Eſter</hi> ſeeme to ſpeake: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a partiall kinde of abſtinence; which is a forbearing of nouriſhing and pleaſant meat one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may not ſometimes ſuffice, as that place of <hi>Daniel</hi> ſeemeth to import, where the Prophet ſpeaking of his faſting, ſaith, <hi>I
<note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 10.3.</note> ate no pleaſant bread, neyther came fleſh nor wine in my mouth, &amp;c. till three whole weekes were fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For anſwer hereto, it muſt firſt of all be noted, that abſtinence vſed in a faſt may be conſidered two wayes. Firſt, in reſpect of one onely act or time of abſtinence, continued without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption; as when it is ſaid, that the Iſraelites

<note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 4.2.</note> 
                  <hi>faſted forty dayes and forty nights:</hi> there is meant one continued act or ſpace of abſtinence, without any intermiſſion or interruption of the abſtinence then vſed. Secondly, It may bee conſidered in reſpect of many multiplyed acts, or diſtinct times of abſtinence, one immediately following after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. As for example, when it is ſaid of the men of <hi>Iabeſh,</hi> that they <hi>faſted
<note n="e" place="margin">1 Sam. 31. vla. &amp;c. 1 Chronao.
12</note> ſeaen dayes,</hi> the meaning is not, that they faſted ſo long, by one continued and vninterrupted act of abſtinence, but that they faſted euery one of thoſe 7. dayes, <pb n="6" facs="tcp:21717:7"/>eating nothing all the day long, and at euening making a ſpare and courſe meale, as was agreeable to a time of mourning. Thus not onely

                  <hi>Toſtatus</hi> doth interpret that place; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth withall, that this <hi>faſt</hi> of theirs <hi>was according to the cuſtome of the Iewes, which was, that they did not eate any thing all the day long, till the Sun-ſet,</hi> but then did eate. And in the like ſence, they of the Romane Church do ſay, that themſelues faſt all Lent, when notwithſtanding, they doe not without interruption obſerue that kinde of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, which themſelues require in a Faſt: for on Sundayes at leaſt, all Lent long, they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their abſtinence, and faſt not, no not after their owne manner of faſting. Sometimes then a man may be ſaid to faſt ſuch a ſpace of time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that time he vſeth ſuch abſtinence, as is required in one vninterrupted act or time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; and ſometimes againe hee may be ſaid to faſt ſo long or for ſuch a time, becauſe hee vſeth ſundry ſuch multiplyed acts or times of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, or becauſe hee vſeth many ſuch Faſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes together, one after another.</p>
               <p>This being firſt noted for a ground, my anſwer to the doubt is:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If wee ſpeake of a faſt, as it conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth of one onely ſingle act, without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the abſtinence required, then it is vnheard of, in Scriptures, that there is any vſe of meate or drinke, or taſting of food, while that faſt laſteth. But if wee ſpeake of a faſt as conſiſting of many <pb n="7" facs="tcp:21717:7"/>ſuch acts, multiplyed and added together, then it is neceſſary, that ſome refreſhing be had between thoſe ſeuerall acts or diſtinct times: and vſuall it is, that ſuch refection then vſed, ſhould be ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for the quantity of meat, and homely for the quality of it. And ſuch a faſt as this was that of <hi>Daniels,</hi> when hee ſaith: <hi>I was mourning three full weekes, I ate no pleaſant bread, &amp;c.</hi> For the meaning is, that hee faſted euery day for three weekes ſpace, without eating or drinking or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting any food all the day long: but when the day was ended, he brake off his abſtinence, by a ſlender ſupper. And ſo this place proueth not, but that a Faſt doth include a totall abſtinence from all meat. And this to be the meaning of the place, I am induced to thinke, becauſe the words doe import ſo much, &amp; the cuſtome of the Iewes in their faſting doth require this conſtruction. For the learned doe agree, that this was the cuſtome of the Iewes, that when they faſted, they did eate nothing all day, till the euening; that by reaſon of this cuſtome, when men are ſaid to faſt many dayes, it may reaſonably be vnderſtood, that they faſted all the day, and at night are ſomething: and that for this cauſe Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> did ſay that Chriſt did <hi>faſt forty dayes, and forty nights,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the mention of nights, leſt men ſhould thinke that he faſted thoſe forty dayes according to the cuſtome of the Iewes, eating at night, after he had abſtayned from food all the day. To this purpoſe <hi>Toſtatus</hi>

               <p n="2">2. That they who thinke that <hi>Daniels</hi> practice doth iuſtifie their choice of meats, in their time of faſting, when they forbeare fleſh onely, and feed on all ſorts of fiſh, and eate cheriſhing rootes, and drinke the ſtrongeſt Wines, are much miſtaken, and build vpon a ſandie ground.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Scriptures wee finde diuers kinds of faſting mentioned; ſome whereof are commended for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious vſes; and others are paſſed ouer, as no way concerning the ſpirituall ſtate of our ſoules. For differencing whereof, we may note theſe diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Diſt.</hi> Some Faſts are neceſſary and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, when men are compelled to faſt, becauſe <pb n="11" facs="tcp:21717:9"/>they haue not either ſtomach or meate. Such was the faſt of the Aegyptian,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30.12.</note> who was forſaken by his company, &amp; being left ſicke in the Fields, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dead for want of victuals. And ſome Faſts again, are voluntary, vndertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a mans own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and by his owne free choyce; of which kind there are many examples in the Scriptures. The former of theſe is rather a hungring then a faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for, <hi>Ieiunium voluntatis eſt, fames neceſsitatis; Faſting is an act of the will, but hunger is of neceſsity,</hi> and whether a man will or no; as Saint <hi>Austin</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Aug. in Pſalm. 42. pag. 138. F.</note> ſpeaketh. And therefore this can bee no act of vertue, becauſe it is not voluntary, but neceſſarie. And conſequently, it is not that Faſt that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for Religion ſake. And therefore the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Faſt onely, is it which belongeth to this place, and is for our purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Diſt.</hi> Voluntary Faſts are of two ſorts. They are either worldly and prophane, or religious and holy.</p>
               <p>Worldly and prophane I call thoſe, whoſe end is for ſome worldly vſe, or for ſome reſpect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this life. And theſe are diuers. For ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times men may faſt for effecting of ſome world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſſe with better ſpeede; as <hi>Saul</hi> and his ſouldiers did, when the people taſted no food, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the King had <hi>adiured them, ſaying;
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.24.</note> Curſed be the man that eateth any foode vntill Euening, that I may be auenged on mine enemies.</hi> Where we ſee the reaſon of this faſt was, becauſe the King would not allow them any time of eating, for that they might beſtow all the time in purſuing of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. <pb n="12" facs="tcp:21717:10"/>And ſo in like ſort a man may faſt for his health, that he may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>coct his vndigeſted humors; &amp; for his gaine, that he may ſpare his purſe; &amp; for the publike good, that he may preſerue the breede of Cattell:

When men faſt for theſe or any ſuch like other ends, their Faſts are worldly and prophane, and therfore haue no place among religious exerciſes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort are holy and religious Faſts. And ſo I call thoſe, which are intended and doe ſerue for ſome ſpeciall vſe, which concerneth Gods glory, and the good of a mans ſoule. To this purpoſe is that, which wee reade in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, where GOD ſpeakes thus to the people;

And when ye did eate, and when ye did drinke, did ye not eate for your ſelues, and drinke for your ſelues?</hi> In which words wee may note, how God doth reiect the Faſts of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe they were not vndertaken for GOD and his ſeruice, but for themſelues, and to ſerue their owne turnes. And this ſheweth, that the Faſts which pleaſe God, muſt be ſuch as may ſerue for his glory. And therefore theſe Faſts doe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to this place. And conſequently, wee may fitly define a religious Faſt, as a learned man hath done;
<note n="c" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But heere a queſtion may bee asked, which it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:21717:10"/>will bee requiſite to reſolue before I goe on. For it may be demanded, If the end of our faſting bee that which maketh the difference between religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and prophane Faſts; what if both theſe ends doe concurre and meete together in one and the ſame act of faſting? As for example, I may faſt for my bodily health, and for preuenting of ſome diſtemper, that fulneſſe would breed; and yet at the ſame time, and by the ſame act, I my beate downe my body, and make it more ſeruiceable to the ſoule, and I may withall preuent pride and wantonneſſe, which full-feeding might procure. Or (which is all to one purpoſe) I may faſt to tame the pride of the fleſh, and to humble my ſelfe for my ſinnes; and withall, by the ſame meanes, I may both ſaue my purſe, and further my health, and preuent ſickneſſe in my body. And when both theſe ends doe in this maner concurre, what a Faſt ſhall I call this? Is it a worldly Faſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath a worldly vſe? or is it a religious Faſt, becauſe it hath a religious vſe? or is it both, becauſe it hath both ends?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Either the one of theſe ends is directly inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the other doth accidentally follow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the mans intendment &amp; purpoſe: or elſe both of them are intended by him that keepeth the faſt. If the one onely be intended, then as the rule is,
<hi>Denominatio ſequitur praestantiorem partem; The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination followeth the preuailing ſide:</hi> ſo we muſt ſay, that the end which is intended, giueth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination to the faſt, and not that which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally concurreth. As for example, if a man <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21717:11"/>onely aime at a ſpirituall end, though another vſe follow vpon it, yet the faſt is religious ſtill. And if he haue onely a worldly purpoſe, though a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall vſe doe accompany it befides his intention, yet the faſt is worldly and prophane notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. But if his intention be mixt, and hee at once, and in the ſame faſt doe propoſe to himſelfe both a worldly and a ſpirituall vſe together; then concerning ſuch a faſt I ſay three things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſo farre forth it partaketh of eyther kinde, as eyther of the vſes are intended, <hi>that is,</hi> the Faſt is ſo farre forth to be called Religious, as a religious vſe is intended in it, and ſo farre forth worldly, as the end is worldly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That ſo much as is mixed of the one end, is diminiſhed of the other. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if a man faſt, partly that hee may hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelfe by ſorrow for his ſinne, and partly that by concocting raw humours hee may gayne the better health, this latter reſpect doth ſo much diminiſh of the worth of the former, as it ſelfe is herein intended. And the reaſon is, becauſe the intentions of a mans minde cannot entirely and perfectly be imployed vpon two contrary or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers obiects at once. And therefore, ſo much of his intention as a man beſtoweth vpon himſelfe, ſo much hee taketh away from God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is not ſafe to mingle a worldly and ſpirituall reſpect together in one &amp; the ſame Faſt, if wee may with conueniency ſeparate and diuide them. My reaſon is, becauſe wee (ſuch is our corruption) are apt to flatter our ſelues, and thinke <pb n="15" facs="tcp:21717:11"/>better of our workes than they doe deſerue: and if one action may both make for Gods honor, and our owne profit, wee are ready to thinke wee doe all for God, when the greateſt part is for our ſelues. And therefore the ſafeſt way will bee to ſeuer and diſioyne theſevſes, if with conueniency wee may doe it, that ſo while we faſt for God, we may not haue any worldly reſpect that may moue vs vnto it at the ſame time. And becauſe the eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reſpects of the world that doe moſt vſually intermingle themſelues with our holy Faſts, are one of the two, eyther reſpect of gayne, by ſauing the charges of dyet, or preſeruing of health, by concocting of raw humours: Wee may for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in theſe caſes, take theſe two Rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Rule, That if faſting be neceſſary for our health, wee firſt vſe it ſo long and ſo much as is needfull for that purpoſe, and then at other times vndertake our religious Faſts, that ſo wee may ayme onely at a ſpirituall vſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Rule, That when by faſting we ſaue char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, we then giue away our ſauings to the poore, without diminiſhing any other part of our almes. And ſo doing, wee ſhall not onely free our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Faſts from the tincture of worldly thrift, but ſhall alſo exerciſe another holy duety of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſſe and charity. A thing which the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers haue thought moſt neceſſary at the times of our faſting: and therefore haue beene vſed to greſſe this duety with much earneſtneſſe in their Sermons to the people.

                  <hi>Diſt.</hi> 3. Religious faſts are of two ſorts; they are eyther publique or priuate faſts. Publique I call thoſe, when a whole company, as when a Citie, Towne, or Pariſh doe by publique order ioyne together in this ſeruice. Such a faſt was that of the <hi>Nineuites</hi> in the third Chapter of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> and that which was preſcribed to the Iewes in the fourth of <hi>Eſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the priuate faſt is, when men out of their owne deuotions, and by their owne directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doe in their priuate houſes vſe abſtinence in a religious manner. Such a faſt was that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> mentioned in his tenth Chapter: and that of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his Booke. And both theſe kindes, both the priuat and publique faſts, haue their approbation in Scriptures, and are commendable if they be vſed aright, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the examples alledged already, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21717:12"/>will more fully appeare afterwards in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſt.</hi> 4. Religious faſts, whether priuate or publique, may againe be diuided into two ſorts; For ſome are extraordinary, and others are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. The extraordinary are ſuch, as are kept vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome ſpeciall and extraordinary occaſion, as eyther for remouing of ſome ſpeciall iudgement, then eyther felt or feared, or for obtayning of ſome benefit or bleſſing, whereof then there is eſpeciall need and exigence. Such was the faſt of the <hi>Nineuites,</hi> which they vndertooke vpon the feare of deſtruction threatned by the Prophet. And ſuch was the faſt of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke vpon occaſion of his Childes ſickneſſe, and danger of death in him. The ordinary faſts are ſuch as are kept for an vſuall exerciſe of the ſoule, without any other cauſe than ſuch as may befall euery one of vs at all times. Now for the former of theſe kindes of faſting, it is generally agreed, that they are both lawfull and vſefull: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the later, that is the ordinary, there hath a queſtion beene made by ſome later Diuines, who diſpute &amp; determine againſt the vſe of them. But (as I take it) the caſe is cleare enough to the contrary. And my reaſons are: firſt, becauſe this kinde of faſt hath approbation in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and ſecondly, becauſe it hath the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vſes for our ſoules, for which religious faſts were ordayned.</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Reaſon firſt from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> becauſe it hath approbation from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For I reade, that God himſelfe commanded <pb n="18" facs="tcp:21717:13"/>an ordinary faſt to be obſerued by the Iewes eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yeere.
<note place="margin">Leuit. 16.29.</note> 
                  <hi>This</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>ſhall be a Statute for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto you, that in the ſeuenth moneth, in the tenth day of the moneth, yee ſhall afflict your ſoules, &amp;c.</hi> Where that the afflicting ſpoken of was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by inward ſorrow for their ſinnes, and partly by outward abſtinence from meat and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments of nature, is agreed vpon by all ſides. And that this abſtinence and humiliation was an ordinary exerciſe of pietie, cannot bee doubted, if we conſider that it was appoynted euery yeere, and in the ſame moneth, and vpon the ſame day. For it is not to bee imagined, that extraordinary occaſions of humiliation ſhould happen euery yeere vnto the ſame people, and at the ſame time, and vpon the ſame day. And if Almightie God himſelfe ſaw it to be ſo vſefull for the Iewes to humble themſelues by an ordinary faſt, for their ordinary ſins, and in the ordinary courſe of their liues; why ſhould it be thought ſinfull in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to humble themſelues in the ſame manner, and vpon the ſame occaſion? Secondly, we finde in Scriptures, that the
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matt. 9.14.</note> 
                  <hi>Phariſes faſted often,</hi> and for example ſake, that they
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Luk. 18.12.</note> 
                  <hi>faſted twice in the weeke;</hi> and that concerning thoſe faſts of theirs, our Lord gaue his Diſciples this warning,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Matt. 6.16.</note> 
                  <hi>When yee faſt, bee not as the hypocrites, of a ſad counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, for they disfigure their faces, that they may appeare vnto men to faſt. Verily I ſay vnto you, they haue their reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of which paſſages wee may gather two things. Firſt, that theſe faſts of the Phariſes were <pb n="19" facs="tcp:21717:13"/>ordinary faſts, and obſerued by them in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of life, and for an ordinary exerciſe of religion. For that theſe men ſhould ſo often haue extraordinary occaſions, eſpecially that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery weeke twice, is a thing that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with any probability or reaſon. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that theſe faſts, ſuch as they were, were not vnlawfull in themſelues. That I proue, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Sauiour, where hee purpoſely taxeth their vices, reproueth them for their purpoſe, not for their practice of faſting; or not becauſe they did faſt, but becauſe they did faſt to gaine prayſe of men for it. Now had they offended in both, out of doubt our Lord would haue reproued them for both, and haue fore-warned his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to beware of both. Secondly, becauſe in ſaying of the Phariſes, that they faſting for vaine glory had their reward, hee meant that they might not expect any reward from God, ſeeing they did it for the applauſe of men: and hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth by neceſſary conſequence, that if they had not marred this good worke with ſo ill an end, they might haue had a reward from God for it. And if God reward ordinary faſts, what man will dare to condemne them?
<note place="margin">Luke 2.37.</note> Thirdly, wee reade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſſe, that ſhee <hi>depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not from the Temple, but ſerued God with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings and prayers night and day.</hi> In which ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence wee may conſider two things for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: firſt, that this holy woman made a dayly practice of faſting; ſhee ſerued God in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner night and day: which ſheweth, that ſhe faſted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21717:14"/>ordinarily, and for an ordinary exerciſe of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Secondly, That by this kinde of faſting ſhe ſerued God. And if ſhee ſerued God by her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, we need not feare, leſt wee diſhonour him by the like practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reaſon ſecond from the vſes.</note>Secondly, That ordinary faſts are lawfull and vſeful, may be proued, becauſe ordinary faſts may and doe ſerue for thoſe profitable vſes, for which religious faſts were ordayned. For thoſe vſes are, to teſtifie and helpe forward our humiliation and repentance, to ſharpen and whet on our attention in holy dueties, and to ſubdue and tame the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly pride of the fleſh, and ſuch like: the reſpect whereof is the onely thing that maketh faſting ſo much commended to vs in the Scriptures. But all theſe holy ends and vſes may be attayned or furthered no leſſe by ordinary than by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary faſts. For not onely our faſtings, when wee keepe them for ſome ſpeciall and extraordinary occaſion, but euen thoſe alſo which wee vſe in an ordinary and vſuall courſe of Chriſtianity, may tame the fleſh by ſubtracting its food, may eleuate the minde towards God, by eſtranging it from the ſence of worldly things, and may both ſhew and beget our humiliation and ſorrow by chaſtening the body for the ſinnes of our ſoules, as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in common reaſon: nor is it needleſſe in an ordinary courſe of life to vſe ſuch eyther helpes or ſignes of humiliation, deuotion, and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For our infirmities in all theſe kindes are many and great, and had need of helpe euery day: and our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions happen <pb n="21" facs="tcp:21717:14"/>dayly, nay hourely, and doe require euery day humiliation and ſorrow: and hence it followeth, that this ordinary courſe of faſting vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and vſuall occaſions of our life, are neither needleſſe nor fruitleſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus in concluſion it appeareth, that all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faſts, be they priuate or publike, and whether for ordinary or extraordinary occaſions, haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance from God, and are of good vſe in the life of a Chriſtian.</p>

For which purpoſe,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Exod. 3.5.</note> God commanded
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and the
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ioſh. 5.15.</note> Angell commanded
<hi>Ioſhua; Put off thy ſhooes from off thy feet; for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt, is holy ground.</hi> The meaning of which ceremonie was for this end, that thereby they might ſhewe reuerence in the place, where God did manifeſt his preſence. And the like vſe there may be of faſting alſo; and that in two reſpects. 1. Becauſe, we doe by ſuch demeanour humble our ſelues before the Diuine Maieſtie, as vnworthy not only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy his preſence, but to make vſe of any of his creatures. Which is a teſtimony as of our owne baſeneſſe, ſo of Gods excellencie and greatneſſe. 2. We may by our abſtinence ſhew reuerence to God, becauſe by forbearing our meate when wee are about his workes, we declare that we preferre his ſeruice before the ſeruing of our owne turnes: as deeming it moſt iuſt, that his ſeruice ſhould haue the firſt place in all our thoughts.

And for this interpretation there may bee giuen this reaſon, that the <hi>rubbing of corne</hi> for ſtaying of <pb n="23" facs="tcp:21717:15"/>hunger, was ſo ſmall a worke, that in reaſon it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to offend any, no not a Phariſee; it beeing leſſe labour then euery man doth vſe at his ordinary meale on the Sabbath day.

But let this goe for a coniecture, (as I will not vrge it for any point of faith) thus much is certaine, that the Chriſtian Church hath ſtill bin accuſtomed to forbeare all foode, when they were to receiue the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, till the whole worke and ſeruice of God were ended: whereof

And this may ſhew, what reſpect we haue of our God, and what reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence we beare to his Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="2">II. A ſecond holy vſe of a religious Faſt may be for
<hi>mortification,</hi> and to take downe the pride of the fleſh. And when I ſay the <hi>pride</hi> of the fleſh, I doe not meane vncleane luſts and vnchaſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires onely; but I meane alſo all vnruly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious thoughts, as pride, ſelfe-willednes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractarines, and all diſobedience that oppoſeth it ſelfe againſt God and his holy Word. For fulnes of bread, and pampering of the fleſh, as they doe more immediately and directly breede matter for vnchaſte and fleſhly luſts: ſo they do conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="25" facs="tcp:21717:16"/>prepare a way, and diſpoſe a man to all other ſinnes, which his owne pleaſure and ſelfe-will doe leade him vnto, and from which the awe of Gods Word and the regard of his Iudgements ſhould withdraw him. Of the former, that is, of vnchaſt luſts bred by full dyet, the Lord ſpeaketh by the Prophets mouth;
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ier. 5.7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>When I fed them to the full, then they committed adulterie, and aſsembled by troupes in the harlots houſes. They were as fed horſes in the morning: euery one neighed after his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wife.</hi> And of the latter ſort of ſinnes, that is, of other vnruly and rebellious paſſions, bred by full feeding,
<hi>Moſes</hi> giueth proofe, when hee ſaith;
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Deut. 32.15.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieſhurun waxed fat and kicked. Thou art waxen fat, thou art growen thicke, thou art couered with fatneſſe. Then he for fooke God that made him, and lightly eſteemed the Rocke of his ſaluation.</hi> Heere wee haue a grieuous, but iuſt complaint againſt this rebellious people; wherein wee may note, Firſt, who they were that thus hee complaines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt;
<hi>Ieſhurun,</hi> ſaith the Text. The word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth as much as vpright, and it is the ſurname of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> becauſe that people ſhould be the moſt vpright of all people in the world. Theſe were the men, that were thus faultie, and were thus complained againſt. Secondly, what the occaſion was, that drew them into this diſorder, and that is this;
<hi>They were waxen fat, growen thicke, couered with fatnes.</hi> By which phraſes, as we may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all worldly proſperity in generall, ſo more eſpecially we muſt vnderſtand plentifull dyet and full feeding; as it is more plainely declared, <hi>verſe</hi> 
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:21717:17"/>13, 14. Thirdly, what the ſin was that they fell into, and by which they occaſioned ſo grieuous a complaint againſt them; and that is thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<hi>They kicked, they forſooke God, they lightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed the Rocke of their ſaluation.</hi> In which words, <hi>Moſes</hi> vſeth the ſame metaphore that <hi>Ieremie</hi> did in the place alledged; but hee extendeth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it further. For it is, as if hee ſhould ſay; This people are as like to fed horſes as may be. For as horſes which prouender &amp; high kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping doe make proud, doe kicke, and ſtrike, and throwe downe their Rider; ſo this people, being pampered and fed to the full, grow ſtubborne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and contemne his Word and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and caſt away his Yoke from them. Now lay all this together, and it yeeldeth vs this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, That full feeding is apt to puffe vp the beſt men, and to make them kicke and ſpurne againſt God and all good admonitions. Which conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſſeth yet more plainely in the precedent Chapter, where hee bringeth in God thus fore-telling the peoples maners:
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Deut. 31.20.</note> 
                  <hi>When</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſhall haue brought them into the Land, which I ſware vnto their Fathers, that floweth with milke and honey, and they ſhall haue eaten and filled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and waxen fat; then will they turne vnto other gods and ſerue them, and prouoke me, and breake my Couenant.</hi> Where we may obſerue, that fulnes and plentie is ſaid to be the cauſe of idolatrie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God. But on the contrary ſide, faſting, and pinching of the body, and putting it to hardneſſe, they are meanes to coole the bloud, <pb n="27" facs="tcp:21717:17"/>and tame the ſpirits, and pull downe the pride of the fleſh. A plaine proofe hereof we haue in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was well acquainted with Chriſtian diſcipline and meanes of mortification,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 9. vlt.</note> 
                  <hi>I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>keepe vnder my body and bring it into ſubiection; lest that by any meanes when I haue preached vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I my ſelfe ſhould be a caſt-away.</hi> This place is well worth the noting, and that we may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to make the better vſe of it, two things may be conſidered in it.
1. The diſcipline and practice of mortification, which the Apoſtle vſed toward himſelfe: and of that hee ſaith two things. 1. <hi>I keepe vnder my body,</hi> or, as others reade and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>contundo, I beate downe my body.</hi> The meaning is, he vſed ſeuere diſcipline toward himſelfe, faſtings, and watchings, &amp; hard lodging, and rough clothing, &amp;c. by which hee did afflict and macerate the fleſh; much vnlike to nice and tender folkes now a dayes, who cannot endure faſting, becauſe (forſooth) it breedeth winde in the body, and will make them faintiſh. 2. He ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>I bring my body into ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> that is, by this kinde of Diſcipline that I vſe, I make my fleſh gentle and plyable, and ready to hearken and ſubmit to the inſtructions of Gods Word, and the motions of the Spirit. And his meaning in moe words is this, that the fleſh, if it be pampered and fed to the full, nay if it bee not ſtraitly bridled, and ſtrictly kept in, it will grow vnruly, and looke to command: but by faſting, and courſe cloathing, and hard labouring, hee taught it obedience &amp; ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

The ſecond thing conſiderable in his ſpeech, is the reaſon why, or the end for which hee vndertooke ſo hard a courſe, and (as one of vs would thinke) was ſo vnmercifull and cruell toward himſelfe; and that was, <hi>Leſt</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>when I haue preached to others, my ſelfe ſhould be a caſt-away.</hi> But what?

Yes ſurely, or elſe the bleſſed Apoſtle did ſpeake and doe, hee knew not what, nor wherefore. The conſideration whereof may yeeld vs two good meditations for our vſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the world is ſurely much awrie now a dayes; men be ſo croſſe to the Apoſtles courſe. For we may ſee men and women feeking the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets for the beſt Cates, and the Vintners cellars for the beſt Wine, and the Confectioners ſhops <pb n="29" facs="tcp:21717:18"/>for the beſt banketting-ſtuffe: (a thing not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, if it be done moderately, and in ſeaſon) but amidſt all this care for pampering of the fleſh; where is hee or ſhee that once thinketh of <hi>beating down</hi> the body, or taming of the fleſh, or vſing any diſcipline of mortificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Nay, would God there were not ſome among them who would be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religious Chriſtians, who conceit all ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity to be Monkiſh, &amp; ſuperſtitious &amp; vngodly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all, euen the beſt of vs, if wee doe not thinke our ſelues more ſpirituall than Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> muſt confeſſe and reſolue, that wee haue neede to <hi>pull downe</hi> by deedes of humiliation, the luxuriant pride of the fleſh; and that it is a rule, deriued from the nature of man, that <hi>Mens repleta, ſpinas ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat libidinum, a full fed ſoule ſprouts forth weedes of vnlawfull lusts.</hi> Nor will this ſeeme any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if we weigh things well. For the beſt ground abroad, if it haue nothing but warme ſhowres, and faire Sun-ſhine all the yeere long; if there be no froſt, no ſnow, no winter-ſtormes that may kil the vermin, and keepe downe the weedes: nay, if beſides, there be not a Plough to cut vp the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and an harrow to breake the clods; all men know there will bee ſmall hope of a good harueſt. Of ſuch a piece of ground, wee may ſay as

                  </note> And ſo we may ſay of the heart and ſoule of man, the ground where the good ſeed ſhould grow, that if it haue nothing but feeding, and pampering, &amp; eaſe all the weeke,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21717:19"/>and all the yeere, and all the life long; no froſt nor ſtorme of affliction, no plough nor harrow of mortification, that may by diſcipline and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe tame and ſubdue it; it will bring forth but a little good fruit of true piety and obedience: but thornes, and briers, and vermin, and weeds of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly luſts; theſe will ſpring, and grow apace, till they haue couered the whole face of it. Let <hi>Pauls</hi> practice then be euery Chriſtians patterne. If wee would be freed from feare of being caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes, we muſt keepe vnder the body, and bring it into ſubiection, and by wholeſome diſcipline teach it due obedience.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A third vſe of faſting may bee, that it will ſerue for <hi>cleuation</hi> of the minde, and to make a man more attentiue about holy dueties. And this it will doe for diuers reaſons and in diuers reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it cleareth the braine of vapors, and the body of humours, and ſetteth the ſpirits at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for voluntary imployments, and the vſe of contemplation. For reaſon telleth vs, that bodily food ſendeth fumes into the head, and findeth worke for the ſpirits, and imployeth them about the worke of nature, that they are not ſo free for meditation and ſtudy. And Schollers doe finde it true in experience, that times after dinner and ſupper are not ſo fit for inuention and ſtudy: and others may obſerue, that in the afternoone them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are not ſo fit to heare, or reade, or pray, as in the morning, when they are faſting. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, in moſt men, eſpecially in ſuch as are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21717:19"/>ſtill at a full table, faſting may ſerue for
<hi>eleuation,</hi> and to carry the thoughts vpward toward heauen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faſting may helpe to <hi>eleuate</hi> the minde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by afflicting the body, it bringeth a man to the ſenſe and feeling of his wants: and the ſenſe of his wants will ſpurre him forward to the means that may relieue them. And ſo it will make men more attentiue to Gods Word, when he teacheth and admoniſheth them, and more attentiue to their owne words, when they pray vnto him, and prayſe him: and euer and anon to ſigh towards heauen in the middeſt of their other cares. To giue ſome proofe of this; firſt, <hi>Elihu</hi> in the Book of <hi>Iob,</hi> ſpeaking of the afflictions, which God lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on his Children: <hi>If righteous men,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be bound in fetters, and holden in cords of affliction; then God ſheweth them their worke, and their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions, that they haue exceeded. Hee openeth alſo their eare to diſcipline. Iob</hi> 36.8, 9, 10. and <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Hee deliuereth the poore in his affliction, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their eares in oppreſsion.</hi> It is, as if hee ſhould ſay; In time of proſperity and peace men ſtoppe their eares againſt wholeſome admonitions, and are heauy ſpirited: as the Prophet ſpeaketh of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Zachar. 7.7, 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>When it was inhabited, and was in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, they refuſed to hearken, and pulled away the ſhoulder, and ſtopped their eares, that they ſhould not heare: yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant ſtone, leſt they ſhould heare the Law.</hi> But when the rod of God is vpon them, then by the ſmart which they feele, God doth vnſtop their eares, and maketh them attend to euery word that may <pb n="32" facs="tcp:21717:20"/>concerne them for their eaſe. And ſo, if we cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten our ſelues with our owne rodde, with faſting and hard diſcipline, by which wee amerce our ſelues for our ſinnes, the ſenſe of this ſmart will <hi>open our eares</hi> to liſten, and enlarge our hearts to attend to euery word, that may help to diſcharge vs of this burden of ſinne. Let who will marke and obſerue it, and he ſhal find, that at ſuch a time when affliction lyeth vpon him, whether inflicted by God, or impoſed by himſelfe for his ſinne, that then he heareth more willingly, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth more clearely, and applyeth more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his conſcience, euery word that hee heareth or readeth, than at other times hee was wont to doe. And this ſheweth, that the ſenſe of ſmart for our ſins maketh vs attentiue to Gods Word, and gracious admonitions. Secondly, we reade againe that the Lord himſelfe by the Prophet ſaith of his people,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Hoſ. 5.15.</note> 
                  <hi>In their affliction they will ſeeke mee earely.</hi> Before hee had ſaid, <hi>I will goe and returne to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeeke my face.</hi> But ſome might ſay, <hi>Till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeeke thy face?</hi> Why? When (Lord) will that bee? Will this people, that haue forſaken thee, and made themſelues Idols, and doe deſpiſe thy Prophets, will theſe men euer ſeeke thee? Yes, ſaith God, that they will: euen theſe men, <hi>in their affliction,</hi> and when the rodde is vpon them, theſe will <hi>ſeeke mee,</hi> and that <hi>earely</hi> too: that is, it will be the firſt and the chiefeſt of their cares. And ſo, when for our ſinnes our owne hand is vpon vs, it will make <pb n="33" facs="tcp:21717:20"/>vs runne vnto God, and to ſeeke his fauour before all the world; to get remiſſion of thoſe ſinnes, which, our ſelues being Iudges, doe deſerue ſo great correction. And this ſheweth, that the ſenſe of ſmart for ſinne, will make vs attentiue to our prayers, and deuout in all holy dueties.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Faſting may ſerue for <hi>eleuation</hi> of mind, becauſe it abridgeth vs of worldly delights and comforts. For when we are moſt eſtranged from theſe, then are wee moſt ready to ſeeke comfort in God. For worldly pleaſures, eſpecially if there be a continuall enioying of them, they doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange our mindes from heauenly meditations; and that partly becauſe they take vp the time, that ſhould be beſtowed on ſuch thoughts; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe there is ſuch an oppoſition between worldly delights and ſpirituall comforts, that hee who is filled with the one, cannot reliſh the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this it may ſeeme the Apoſtle meant: but ſure ſomething he ſaw, why worldly delights, though lawfull in themſelues, doe yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hinder holy meditations, when
<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 7.5.</note> he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this counſell to religious couples, that they ſhould forbeare the company of each other, <hi>that they might giue themſelues to faſting and prayer,</hi> implying withall, that men and women are moſt deuoted to heauenly thoughts, when they are moſt eſtranged from worldly delights.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Faſting may help to <hi>eleuate</hi> the mind to heauenly meditations, becauſe it doth temper and qualifie our naturall ioyes and worldly reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, and teacheth vs how to referre them to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21717:21"/>their right ends. For ioyes and delights of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if a man ſtill giue himſelfe to the enioying of them, doe not onely preſſe downe the ſoule for the preſent, as hath beene ſaid; but they doe beſides ſo poſſeſſe the minde, and habituate (as it were) the ſoule of a man with their reliſh, that when hee hath done vſing of them, yet hee hath not done thinking on them. And this made
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Quintil. inſtit. l. 12. cap. vlt. pag. 753.</note> 
                  <hi>Quintilian</hi> to ſay, that Students, who are giuen to ſports and tender care of their bodies, will neuer proue learned men, partly, becauſe they miſ-ſpend much time in theſe vanities, and partly becauſe, <hi>ne ea quidem tempora idonea quae ſuperſunt, the time which is remayning is not fit for ſtudies.</hi> And ſo it is in reſpect of the exerciſes of religion. If we giue our ſelues ſtill to worldly, though lawfull pleaſures, they doe ſo drowne a mans ſoule, that when hee ceaſeth from them, yet hee is not fit ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to pray with deuotion, or to heare with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, or to doe any other holy worke with minding of what he is about. But now this holy diſcipline of faſting, if it bee holily vſed, it will helpe to moderate our pleaſures, that wee exceed not in them, and to ſeaſon and qualifie and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per them for an holy vſe: ſo that the ſame world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, which make another man to wax wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton againſt Chriſt, will make this man more chearefull in Gods ſeruice, and with
<hi>Dauid</hi> to <hi>dance,</hi> when hee bringeth home the Arke of God. And as
<note n="(b)" place="margin">2 King. 3.15.</note>
                  <hi>Eliſha,</hi> by hearing a <hi>Minſtrell play,</hi> was fitted to receiue heauenly reuelations, and then fell on prophecying: ſo, if by a ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable <pb n="35" facs="tcp:21717:21"/>practice of humiliation, wee haue made our way to Gods fauour, then if wee feaſt and heare muſicke, and vſe honeſt recreations, euen theſe worldly delights will fit vs for heauenly inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and lift vp our hearts to prayſe God with alacrity and chearefulneſſe of mind. And this we may well ſuppoſe was the reaſon, why the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church hath ſet <hi>faſting</hi> dayes before
<hi>feſtiuall</hi> dayes, and appoynted abſtinence to be an Vſher to our feaſting, that our ſorrow for ſinne on the former day, might turne our mirth the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing into an holy reioycing in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>Thus, in diuers reſpects, faſting may helpe to
<hi>elcuate</hi> the ſoule, and kindle the fire of zeale and deuotion. And for theſe, or ſome ſuch reſpects as theſe,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Baſſl. de Ieiun. Homil. 1. pag.
327.</note> Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> and after him
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Aug. in Pſal. 42. in fine.</note> Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin,</hi> do compare faſting to the <hi>wing</hi> of a Fowle; becauſe as worldly delights like <hi>bird-lime</hi> doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the ſoule, and depreſſe her thoughts vnto this earth; ſo abſtinence like the birds wings doth make the ſoule to ſoare aloft, and carryeth her prayers into heauen. And
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ambroſ. de Elia &amp; ieiun. cap. 3. pa. 527.</note> Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Elias</hi> his Faſt, ſaith of it, <hi>Hoc gradu Elias aſcendit, antequam curru, Elias went vp into heauen by this ladder of faſting, before hee aſcended thither in the chariot of fire.</hi> And the learned of this age, ſuch as I haue had occaſion to peruſe, doe generally agree vpon this note, that faſting and prayer are often and vſually ioyned together in Scriptures, becauſe they goe together in our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, abſtinence euer adding life to our prayers.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21717:22"/>But if any man will pleaſe to make tryall in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, his owne experience will be a better proofe than all ſayings of other men, and all arguments that wit and reaſon can deuiſe. And I wiſh that cyther this or any other conſideration might moue religious mindes to make tryall of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; that ſo they might be able to iudge of it out of their feeling, and not by heare-ſay. And if after tryall made in religious manner, they find not their attention more quicke, their deuotion more fiery, their prayers more feruent, their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations more ſpirituall, and themſelues, as it were, turned into other men: then they may ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that the ancient Fathers of the Church, and the learned Writers and Preachers of our owne time, yea and the Prophets and Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, haue with faire words perſwaded men to vnneceſſary paines. But if any ſhall ſeriouſly bend himſelfe to make tryall of this counſell, hee will finde the like euent, I doubt not, that the men of Samaria did by comming to heare Chriſt. When the woman told them what ſtrange things ſhee had found in Chriſt, and exhorted them,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ioh. 4.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Come, ſee a man, which told mee all things that euer I did. Is not this the Chriſt?</hi> They, giuing ſome credence to the womans word, went to make tryall them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; and after tryall made, then they ſaid to the woman,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">verſ. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>Non mee beleene, not becauſe of thy ſaying: for wee haue heard him our ſelues, and doe know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Sauiour of the world.</hi> So, if any well-minded Chriſtian, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word of ſo many learned Fathers &amp; Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <pb n="37" facs="tcp:21717:22"/>will but in due manner begin the worke, I doubt not but after tryall he will ſay, <hi>Now I beleeue</hi> the ſpirituall vertues that this exerciſe hath, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> or any other, eyther Father, or Doctor, or Preacher ſaith ſo, but becauſe my ſelfe by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence finde and feele it to be ſo.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. A fourth and laſt vſe of faſting is, that it ſerueth for an act or helpe of <hi>Repentance:</hi> and that two wayes. For firſt it is an act, that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and floweth from repentance. And ſecondly it is an act, that breedeth or increaſeth our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And in both theſe reſpects, it may well be eſteemed as a neceſſary companion that goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with repentance. For in the one reſpect it is as a
<hi>follower,</hi> that commeth after and waiteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. And in the other, it is as an <hi>vſher,</hi> that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before and maketh way for it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, it is a neceſſary companion to follow after and waite vpon repentance: and thus it is neceſſary in two reſpects. 1. That our ſorrow may be anſwerable to our ſinne. For we ſinne, not in inward deſires only, but in outward both ſpeehes and actions: or wee ſinne in thought, word and deede. And reaſon requireth, that the plaiſter ſhould be as large as the ſore; and ſo, that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhould ſpread it ſelfe as farre as the offence hath done. This the <hi>Nineuites</hi> obſerued in their repentance. They <hi>put on haire-cloth,</hi> and <hi>faſted,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſate downe in aſhes.</hi> By which <hi>behauiour of theirs, they ſeemed to intend thus much,</hi> (ſaith a Reuerend and learned Writer)

And in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement thereof, as guiltie within our ſelues, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer thou haſt giuen vs to enioy for comfort, for pleaſure, for ſeruice, or any other vſe, eyther in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies at home, or in our foulds and ſtalls abroad, wee reſigne it into thy hands, as hauing no right vnto it; we lay it downe at the feete of thy iuſtice, and only for thine own ſake beſeech thee to ſhew mercy.</hi> In this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner their repentance, as it firſt ſprung in the heart, ſo it ſprouted and ſhewed it ſelfe in the geſtures of the body. And ſo muſt ours do; or elſe the plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will be too little for the wound. Secondly, faſting is neceſſary, as a follower of our repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that our outward humiliation may prooue the truth of our inward ſorrow. For the heart is vſed to expreſſe his inward affections by outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as it expreſſeth his vncleane thoughts by wanton lookes and vnchaſte geſtures, and vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourie ſpeeches; and his ioy and inward reioyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by ſinging &amp; dancing, and a cheerefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.

                  <hi>Repentance <pb n="40" facs="tcp:21717:24"/>without faſting is idle.</hi> The meaning is, that as S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith;
<hi>Faith without workes is dead,</hi> .i. it is no true faith, if it bring forth no fruites: ſo if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance do not bring forth fruites of repentance, faſting and mourning and humiliation, it may be feared, leſt it bee a dead and fruitleſſe repentance. And this made our Lord to ſay of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> that they would haue
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Luk. 10.13.</note> 
                  <hi>repented, ſitting in ſack-cloth and aſhes:</hi> meaning that they would haue repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeriouſly and vnfaignedly. And ſure no man among vs would thinke that that woman did true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow for her husbands death, that would thinke it too much to weare a mourning gowne and a blacke paire of gloues at his funerall. And as great reaſon there is, to thinke that he doth not greatly ſorrow for ſinne, that will neuer faſt and chaſten himſelfe for ſinne.</p>
               <p>And if this be ſo, how great cauſe haue wee to bee ſorry, that wee haue ſhewed ſo little ſorrow; and to repent that we haue expreſſed ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance hitherto? Surely, if wee muſt try the tree by its fruite, and iudge of our repenting by our faſting; wee ſhall finde but little ſtore of this vertue in the world: ſo that we may iuſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
<note place="margin">D. King on Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Lecture 36. page
491.</note> as ſometime an eloquent and learned Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher did: <hi>Where is the Repentance of our times? Whither is it fled? Where hath it hid her ſelfe? &amp;c. It is not for the Angels to repent, becauſe they ſinne not. Nor for the Deuils of hell; for their iudgement is ſealed. It is onely for the ſonnes of men, and wee onely know it not. The people of Nineuch ſinned, and would not eate; ſinned, and would not drinke; ſinned, <pb n="41" facs="tcp:21717:24"/>and would not be cloathed; nay, ſinned, and would not giue leaue to their beaſts to feede: we ſinne, and yet we eate; nay, we ſinne in eating, &amp;c. we ſinne, and yet we drinke; nay, we ſinne in drinking, &amp;c. and we ſinne, and cloath our ſelues; or rather we cloath our ſelues, and ſinne by cloathing vs, &amp;c.</hi> But if any man notwithſtanding all this, can perſwade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that he may repent well inough within in his heart, though he ſhew it not without by deedes of the body; I will onely reply vpon him, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> did in a like caſe. <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes,</hi> ſaith he. And ſo ſay I,
<hi>Shew</hi> me thy <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> by thy <hi>workes:</hi> or if thou canſt not ſhew it, I am not bound to beleeue it. And this ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſhew how faſting doth follow and flowe from Repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, faſting is neceſſary to repentance, as an Vſher that goeth before it, and maketh way for it; I meane, becauſe it is a meanes to beget and increaſe it. And ſurely, the leſſe vſe we haue made of it in the former reſpect, as a fruit ſpringing out of our repentance; the more need we haue of it in this latter, that it may bee a helper to forward our repentance. And that it may doe two wayes, or for two cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the outward acts and behauiour of the body, as they come firſt from the heart,

A.</note> ſo they reflect vpon the heart againe, and there they doe increaſe and confirme that affection, from which they ſprang. This Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued long agoe in the outward geſtures of prayer. When a <hi>man prayeth</hi> (ſaith he) and <hi>kneeleth him
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21717:25"/>downe vpon his knees, and ſpreadeth his hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heauen; be vſeth that geſture of body, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a ſuppliant to vſe</hi> in his prayers. And hee addeth, <hi>I know not how,</hi> but ſo it is, that theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the body, as they had their firſt beeing from the affection of the ſoule, ſo they doe againe ſtirre vp the affection that bred them; <hi>ac per hoc cordis affectus, qui vt fierent iſta praeceſsit, quia facta ſunt, creſcit; and hereby the affection of the heart that cauſed them, is afterward increaſed by them.</hi> For deuotion in the heart doth caſt downe the body on the earth, and lifteth vp the hands and eyes toward heauen: and this proſtration of the body, and eleuation of the hands and eyes, doe blowe the coales of deuotion, and maketh them burne the more brightly. And ſo, it is repentance in the heart, that maketh men to exerciſe diſcipline vpon the body: but this outward diſcipline in faſting, and watching, and hard lodging, they confirme &amp; increaſe the repentance from whence they came. For if the minde ſhould relent, and begin to forget what it is about, (as

               <p n="2">2. Faſting may breede or increaſe repentance, becauſe it is a penall chaſtiſement, which the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent

Proofes are many, but take one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for all. When
<hi>Ionas</hi> was ſent to <hi>Nineueh,</hi> he turned his backe, and fled to

For by this holy reuenge vpon my ſelfe, I ſhall learne to ſerue my God better.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue declared the holy vſes of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, ſuch as I could thinke on for the preſent. Others, that are not ſtrangers from this exerciſe, may peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture either adde mo, or enlarge theſe. In the meane time, it will not be vnſeaſonable to aduertiſe the Reader of two things concerning the premiſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If any man haue need of theſe, or any of theſe helpes and vſes, then hee may not ſay or thinke that an holy Faſt is ſuperfluous and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe for him. For example, if hee finde that hee hath any diſordered luſts or fleſhly thoughts that are not wholly ſubdued and tamed; but that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they prouoke him to euill, or hinder him from that which is good: then he may make vſe of faſting, becauſe it will ſerue him to <hi>beat downe</hi> his body, and to bring it into ſubiection, that hee <pb n="46" facs="tcp:21717:27"/>may ſerue God the more freely. Or, if hee finde that his prayers and meditations, and other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine exerciſes bee not wholly ſpirituall, without all mixture or fainting; then hee may make vſe of faſting, becauſe it will ſerue to <hi>eleuate</hi> his thoughts, and to carry his prayers with full wing into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And laſtly, if hee finde that hee haue any ſinnes not fully ſorrowed for, and wholly done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but that hee hath need of ſome more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; then hee may make vſe of faſting, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will ſerue him to <hi>humble</hi> his ſoule, and to increaſe godly <hi>ſorrow,</hi> that hee may obtaine par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. But if any man be ſo ſpirituall, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and ſo paſt all frailty of mankinde, that hee neyther needes any more mortifying of his fleſh, nor any more ſharpning of his deuotion, nor any more repentance for his ſinne: I will not ſay that ſuch a man hath any further need of faſting. No, nor can I ſay, that hee hath any more neede of Chriſt, or his death and bloud-ſhed. For he that is ſo perfect, what more neede hath hee of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour? But one thing I dare and will ſay, that God doth accept, and Ieſus Chriſt doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the holy Angels doe reioyce more for one ſinner, that by faſting and mourning doth repent for his ſinnes, than ninety and nine of the moſt perfect men in the world, that thinke they haue no need of repentance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any man ſhall pleaſe to make tryall of this exerciſe, and after his faſting doe not finde theſe holy vſes of it; then hee ſhould examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe how hee carryed and demeaned himſelfe in <pb n="47" facs="tcp:21717:27"/>the performance of this ſeruice: whether he haue not erred in the manner, or ſwarued from the right end, or neglected ſome neceſſary and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall condition, that is required for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And if after due examination it doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that he haue not miſcarried in ſome weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and materiall poynt, I will not ſay nay, but hee may condemne mee for being too lauiſh in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the vertues of this worke. But if it doe appeare, that he haue ſo erred, then let him blame himſelfe that it hath ſucceeded no better. For the Phariſes faſted to an ill end, and loſt thier reward: and the Iewes faſted in an ill manner, and were reproued for their labour. And ſo if any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian erre in the ſame or the like ſort, hee may not thinke by ſuch a faſt to obtaine Gods fauour, or to purchaſe the bleſſings already ſpoken of. Now if any ſhall aske, as perhaps ſome will, what thoſe neceſſary conditions be, that by fulfilling of them, hee may attaine the promiſes annexed to them; this queſtion I ſhall labour, God willing, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, in the next enſuing Chapter.</p>

<note n="(c)" place="margin">Eſr. 8.21.</note> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed a Faſt,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>that wee might afflict our ſelues before our God.</hi> Where wee may note, that the <hi>afflicting</hi> of our ſelues is the very end of our faſting. Thus, in the language of the holy Ghoſt, faſting doth imply a kinde of <hi>afflicting.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if it be rightly vſed, it may be ſaid to <hi>afflict</hi> a man for three reſpects. Firſt, becauſe it doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally breed a kinde of paine to the body. For, when nature wanteth her ordinary nouriſhment, ſhe feedeth vpon the body it ſelfe, and ſucketh and draweth from it its naturall moyſture, and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the iuyce of it. Which action of nature vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe, if it be long and great, doth breed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable paynes, which maketh men to eat their owne fleſh, rather than endure it: and if it be but moderate, yet if it be continued aboue the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and fit time of refreſhing, it will more or leſſe breed ſome ſence of paine. Secondly, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting may be ſaid to <hi>afflict,</hi> becauſe it depriueth a man of his vſuall and accuſtomed refreſhing and <pb n="50" facs="tcp:21717:29"/>comfort. And that without any reall and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue payne, is a kinde of affliction to nature. For if a man that hath beene in place of authority and reſpect, be onely depriued of this honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that priuation alone will be a corraſiue to his ſoule. And if a man that hath beene accuſtomed to liue at his liberty, be commanded to keepe his houſe, though hee lodge as ſoft, and fare as well, and be attended as carefully as euer he was wont; yet this reſtraint in his owne houſe will be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment vnto him, becauſe it is an abridging of his wonted liberty. And ſo abſtinence from meat at the vſuall time, is an
<hi>affliction</hi> to nature, becauſe ſhee miſſeth her wonted comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing. Thirdly, faſting may further be ſaid to
<hi>afflict,</hi> becauſe it is a memoriall, that repreſenteth vnto vs the iuſt cauſes of the greateſt ſorrow. For as when a wife weareth mourning weeds for her Husbands death, if any other occaſion ſhould draw her to ſporting and mirth; yet the ſight of her owne clothes would re-call her, becauſe they are teſtimonies that put her in minde of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands deceaſe, and her owne widdow-hood: ſo out faſting, being vndertaken for humiliation and repentance, is an outward token that calleth our ſinnes to remembrance, that telleth vs how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy we are of the leaſt of Gods mercies, and how obnoxious to damnation, if by repentance wee doe not obtaine pardon. In which caſe, though wee ſhould otherwiſe forget our ſelues, yet the very want of our wonted food will cauſe a ſight, and breed a ſenſe of our wofull eſtate. <pb n="51" facs="tcp:21717:29"/>And this is thought to bee one reaſon, why the Nineuites cauſed their children and cattell to faſt from all food, who notwithſtanding were neither guilty of the ſin, nor capable of repentance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ruefull ſight of their miſeries, and the mourning ſound of their cry, might ſerue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Nineuites ſorrow, whoſe ſinnes had beene the cauſe of all. Thus faſting is in diuers reſpects a kinde of <hi>affliction,</hi> and in the religious vſe of it, was intended by Almighty God for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing is, that this chaſtening muſt be
<hi>moderate,</hi> and not exceed the proportion of euery mans ſtrength and ability. And then it exceedeth this proportion, when it eyther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth nature, or diſableth a man for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and the dueties of his calling. And thus far if a man goe, he goeth beyond the rule of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious faſt. The reaſons are: Firſt, God doth not deſire the hurt of his creature, while hee is about his ſeruice: nay, hee will rather forbeare ſome part of his ſeruice, than an Oxe or an Aſſe ſhall want neceſſary food, as is euident by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours own words related by the Euangeliſt
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Luke 13.15. &amp; 14.5.</note>. And if he will not haue a beaſt to want food, much leſſe would he haue a man to endanger his life or health for ſuch an exerciſe, though tending to his ſeruice. And therefore if any deny neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing to the body, when need doth require, that they may vſe the more auſterity againſt the fleſh,

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21717:33"/>be but a forbearing of meate, till his former glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonie be concocted.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Secondly, there is required in a true Faſt, that our other carriage and behauiour be ſuteable to this of our faſting. My meaning is, that as wee chaſten and afflict the body by abſtinence from meate, ſo we ſhould doe by refraining from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delights and comforts of nature. For elſe the other pleaſure would vndoe that, which by faſting we ſeeke to effect; becauſe they will hinder our humiliation and repentance. Nor is it ſeemely to ioyne gay clothes, and ſweet perfumes, and pleaſant muſicke, and frolike behauiour with this exerciſe of humiliation and ſorrow, no more then it is for him that weareth a mourning gowne for his friends death, to flaunt it in a white hat, and a gay feather, and a coloured ſuite at the ſame time. And for this cauſe it is, that in Scriptures, where faſting is ſpoken of, there is mention alſo of ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and aſhes, and hard lodging, and forbearing of perfumes. As for example,

Thirdly, there is required in a true Faſt, that the inward affection of the heart be anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the outward behauiour of the body: that is, that as by abſtaining from the comforts of this life, we chaſten the body, ſo by a godly ſorrow and vnfained repentance, we humble our ſoules for our ſinnes. And becauſe true repentance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth or implyeth amendment of life, and an heartie practice of all good duties; therfore it is to be vnderſtood, that with a true Faſt there is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily required an holy life. And the reaſon hereof is plaine, becauſe God doth not care for the <hi>opus operatum, the bare worke done:</hi> nor doth faſting <pb n="59" facs="tcp:21717:34"/>pleaſe him, becauſe it is an abſtinence from meat; but becauſe it is a ſigne of repentance, and an help to true deuotion and an holy life.

Wilt thou call this a Faſt, and an acceptable day to the Lord?</hi> Hee meaneth that they faſted, as if they repented for their ſinne, and meant to ſerue God; but they, while they kept their Faſt, continued in their ſinnes: and that this was not a true Faſt, that God euer did require, or would accept. But if this bee not the true Faſt, what then is? Why? It followeth in the next words,
<note n="(d)" place="margin">verſ. 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>Is not this the Faſt that I haue choſen, to looſe the hands of wickednes, to vndoe the heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and to let the oppreſſed goe free, &amp; that ye breake euery yoke? Is it not to deale thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poore that are caſt out, to thy <pb n="60" facs="tcp:21717:35"/>houſe? When thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou couer him, &amp;c?</hi> The ſumme and intent of which words is, that a true Faſt, ſuch as God doth require, and will requite, is to be ioyned with the practice of good workes. For the manner of ſpeech is like to that of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> where he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Iames 2.27.</note> that <hi>pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and vndefiled is this, to viſit the fatherleſſe and widdowes in their affliction, and keepe himſelfe vnſpotted of the world.</hi> Where hee meaneth not that religion, which is a dutie toward GOD, doth formally conſiſt in theſe good workes, the doing of which is a dutie toward man: but that true and <hi>ſound Religion</hi> is neceſſarily and by conſequence ioyned with theſe workes. And ſo when God ſaith, that the Faſt which he requireth, is to <hi>looſe bands of wickednes, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>to deale bread to the hungry, &amp;c.</hi> Hee meaneth not, that a true Faſt doth eſſentially and formally conſiſt in theſe workes, but that it is euer ioyned with them. And the good workes which God requireth to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a religious Faſt, are of two ſorts: ſome are workes of iuſtice, which are to <hi>looſe the bands of wickedneſſe,</hi> to
<hi>vndoe the heauie burdens, &amp;c.</hi> that is, to ſurceaſe and leaue off their oppreſſing, and wronging of their brethren. And ſome againe, are workes of mercy, which are to <hi>deale ones bread to the hungry,</hi> to
<hi>cloathe the naked, &amp;c.</hi> By all which it doth appeare, that God maketh no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of faſting, if it be not ioyned with charity toward the poore, and iuſt dealing towards all men. The ancient Fathers, agreeably to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are eloquent and plentifull in this argument. <pb n="61" facs="tcp:21717:35"/>Saint <hi>Ambroſe,

                  <hi>Doe not place</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the good of faſting in the abſtinence of meat: for true faſting conſiſteth in abſtayning from ſinne.

For hee that is led and poſſeſſed with theſe, hee is not his owne man: hee cannot ſee and diſcerne the way of reaſon, much leſſe of religion, no more than a drunken man can find his way in the ſtreet. And if a man doe abſtaine from wine, and yet be drunke with theſe vices; or if a man forbeare the fleſh of beaſts, and feed on the bloud of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this is no truer a faſt in Gods ſight, than if he ſhould abſtaine from a weaker wine, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme himſelfe with a ſtronger; or ſhould faſt from ſwines fleſh, and glut himſelfe with Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge and Pheaſant. The ſumme of all is, <hi>A true Faſt cannot be ſeparated from an holy life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IIII. Fourthly, it is required that the ſoule doe conſider of, and put in practice ſuch holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as a Faſt doth by the outward behauiour make profeſſion of.</p>
               <p>Some doe require that euery Faſting-day bee kept as an Holy-day, without doing of any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke, and with performing of ſuch religious workes as belong to a Sabbath day. And their reaſon for this is, becauſe God doth command the Iewes, that on their day of <hi>expiation,</hi> in which they were to <hi>afflict</hi> themſelues with faſting, they ſhould doe no worke; but that they ſhould keepe <pb n="63" facs="tcp:21717:36"/>it for a Sabbath of reſt. But this I take to be an errour, at leaſt, I dare not charge it as a neceſſary duety in any mans conſcience, becauſe I know no reaſon to enforce it. For to mine vnderſtanding, the onely place of Scripture, which ſeemeth to incline this way, and vpon which they onely reſt, doth make nothing for it at all. The place is in the ſixteenth of
<hi>Leuiticus,</hi> but eſpecially in the three and twentieth of the ſame Booke, where the ſame words are repeated, and the poynt more fully declared. And therefore I will ſet downe the words there recorded, that the Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may the better conſider of the meaning, and the more clearely ſee what to iudge of the reaſon. The words then are theſe,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Leuitic. 23, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31,
32.</note> 
                  <hi>On the tenth day of this moneth there ſhall be a day of Atonement; it ſhall be an holy conuocation vnto you, and yee ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict your ſoules, and offer an offering made by fire vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord. And yee ſhall doe no worke in that ſame day: for it is a day of Atonement, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God, &amp;c.</hi> For better conceiuing of this Text, we muſt note, firſt, that the ſumme and intention of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is, to ſet downe the Feaſts and the Holy-dayes of the Iewes, which are heere reckoned vp to be, the weekely <hi>Sabbath,</hi> the <hi>Paſseouer,</hi> the <hi>Offering of the firſt fruits, Pentecoſt,</hi> the <hi>Feaſt of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,</hi> the day of
<hi>Expiation,</hi> and the feaſt of <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles.</hi> And concerning theſe, it is ſaid by way of preface in the beginning,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Verſ. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Say vnto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, Concerning the feaſts of the Lord, which yee ſhall proclaime to be holy Conuocations, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <pb n="64" facs="tcp:21717:37"/>theſe are my Feaſts.</hi> And after the enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, it is ſaid,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Verſ. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>Theſe are the Feaſts of the Lord, which hee ſhall proclaime to be holy Conuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to offer an offering made by fire vnto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> And in the end of the Chapter after all it is added, <hi>And Moſes declared vnto the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael the Feaſts of the Lord.</hi> And from hence it may be gathered, that this day of <hi>expiation,</hi> which is placed among theſe holy-dayes, is intended as a <hi>feſtiual</hi> day, rather than as a <hi>faſting</hi> day. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the faſt or humiliation heere commanded, is an appurtenance of the feaſt, and a ſeruice requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on that holy day; &amp; this day was appointed to be kept for an holy day, not becauſe it was a faſting day. Secondly, wee may note in the deſcription of this day, that the chiefe thing for which this day was intended, was for <hi>expiation</hi> and <hi>atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Thirdly, that the meanes by which this might be wrought, and the things which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth for the celebration of this day, were an <hi>holy reſt,</hi> a <hi>publique meeting,</hi> an
<hi>affliction</hi> of the ſoule, and an <hi>offering made by fire.</hi> And hence we may gather, that an holy day and a <hi>faſting</hi> day are here ioyned, as two things, both of which reſpect one end. And therefore it followeth not, The people are here commanded to keepe an <hi>holy</hi> reſt vpon this <hi>faſting</hi> day: and therefore it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that euery
<hi>faſting</hi> day ſhould be kept <hi>holy:</hi> no more than this argument would follow from the ſame place; Here the people are commanded to keepe this <hi>holy</hi> day with <hi>faſting,</hi> and humiliation, and therfore euery <hi>holy</hi> day muſt be a <hi>faſting</hi> day.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21717:37"/>Fourthly, We may note, that the reaſon why God appoynted this day to be kept <hi>holy,</hi> is ſaid in the Text to bee this, becauſe it is a <hi>day of atonement for them before the Lord:</hi> but it is not ſaid that it was to be kept <hi>holy,</hi> becauſe it was a
<hi>faſting</hi> day. And hence I may conclude, that the Text doth giue no warrant that euery <hi>faſting</hi> day muſt bee kept <hi>holy</hi> day. Now let the Reader lay theſe notes and collections from the Text together; and compare them with the reaſon brought to proue the contrary, and hee will eaſily ſee how weake the argument is. For the onely reaſon that euer I read or heard of from this Text for proofe of this concluſion, is this; God heere comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this <hi>faſting</hi> day to be kept holy, and therefore euery <hi>faſting</hi> day muſt be ſo kept. Which being nothing but an inference of an vniuerſall from a ſingular, doth hereby appeare to bee weake and friuolous; beſides the reaſons now alledged from the Text to the contrary. And now after all, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this is the onely place, on which this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer concluſion is grounded, and it hath ſo little reaſon in it, as hath beene ſhewed: it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that to ſay euery <hi>faſting</hi> day of neceſſitie muſt bee an <hi>holy</hi> day, is an errour without all ground of probability.</p>
               <p>The thing then that I meane, when I ſay, that it is required that on the day of our faſt, the ſoule ſhould practiſe ſuch duties, as a Faſting-day by the outward behauiour doth include, is; that as by faſting wee profeſſe our ſorrow for ſinne, with a purpoſe to ſerue God better; and doe abſtaine <pb n="66" facs="tcp:21717:38"/>from fleſhly comforts, that wee may more freely enioy the comforts of the Spirit: ſo a Chriſtian ſhould vſe ſerious meditation and conſideration of things requiſite for this purpoſe. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, hee ſhould examine his conſcience, ſearch out the ſtate of his ſoule, ſettle in himſelfe a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of amendment, confeſſe his ſinnes that make him vnworthy to taſte any of Gods creatures, and pray for grace to liue better. And that theſe and ſuch like holy thoughts and deſires are requiſite vpon our faſting dayes, I am induced to thinke; partly, becauſe in publique Faſts,

For faſting is not like phyſicke, which worketh while a man ſleepeth: but then only affecteth the ſoule, and pleaſeth God, when the heart maketh vſe of it. A plaine proofe whereof may be this; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting hath this ſpeciall vſe, among others, that as the chaſtiſements which GOD doth inflict vpon vs, doe ſerue to humble vs, and bring vs home by repentance; ſo theſe chaſtiſements voluntarily impoſed vpon our ſelues, may ſerue for like purpoſe; as hath beene fully decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red already.

Secondly, the want of feeling in the people, <hi>They know it not:</hi> and againe, <hi>Yet they know not,</hi> ſaith the Text. But what?
<hi>Conſumed</hi> by the Enemy, and not <hi>know</hi> that they were ſtrucken? <hi>pined,</hi> and become old with ſorrow, and not feele their miſery? No, that is not the meaning; they felt their miſery, no doubt. But the Prophet mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that they did not take notice, nor thinke and conſider that it was Gods hand that inflicted this iudgement, and their own ſinnes that deſerued it: and therefore they were neuer the better for all this chaſtiſement.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Aſting rightly vſed, and with the conditions already mentioned, is very auaileable and of great vſe in the life of a Chriſtian. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the ſpirituall helps that wee may haue from it for furthering our deuotion, whereof I ſpake before, it is alſo a powerfull meanes to obtaine helpe and mercie from God in diuers neceſſary caſes, or rather vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery occaſion, wherein we doe ſtand in need of Gods ſpeciall fauour and aſſiſtance. For</p>
               <p n="1">I. Firſt and in generall, it is auaileable to obtaine Gods fauour and goodwill toward vs; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to incline and moue him to helpe and protect vs, and to prouide for vs all good things, and to grant vs all our iuſt and lawfull deſires. And this it doth for diuers cauſes, or in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Faſting is an exerciſe of
<hi>humiliation</hi> and ſubiection, whereby we doe ſubmit and caſt our ſelues downe before Gods feete, as vnworthy, in reſpect of our many ſinnes, to vſe any the leaſt of his creatures. And <hi>humiliation</hi> is a ready way to obtaine fauour. By it
<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 King, 20, 31, &amp;c.</note>
                  <hi>Benhadad</hi> won the heart <pb n="70" facs="tcp:21717:40"/>of the King of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> not onely to ſpare his life, but to intreate him with all kindneſſe: though he had found much hard meaſure from him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before. And by it, ſinfull men, who haue offended God by their ſinnes, may finde ready fauour at Gods hands. For
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iam. 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>he reſiſteth the proud, and giueth grace to the humble.</hi> And if men
<note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Pet. 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelues vnder the mighty hand of God, he will exalt them in due time.</hi> And,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Iſa. 66.2.</note> 
                  <hi>All theſe things hath mine hand made, ſaith the Lord; but to this man will I looke, euen to him, that is poore, and of a contrite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and trembleth at my words.</hi> Which is, as if he ſhould ſay, The heauens and the earth, and the ſeas, and all things within them, all of them bee mine, for I made them, and I preſerue them, and I may command them, and make vſe of them at my pleaſure; but among them all, my delight is, and I make choyce to dwell and reſide with him, that humbleth himſelfe before me. It followeth; And if
<hi>humiliation</hi> be ſo welcome to God, faſting muſt needs obtaine his fauour, when it is rightly vſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe Faſting is an exerciſe of
<hi>Repentance,</hi> and a meanes to worke reformation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life. And <hi>Repentance</hi> and amendment is the ready way to obtaine mercie and fauour. For
<note n="(d)" place="margin">Ioh. 9.31.</note> 
                  <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith the blinde man now reſtored to his ſight) <hi>that God heareth not ſinners: but if any man be a worſhipper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.</hi> In which ſentence there are two things conſiderable. 1. The ſentence it ſelfe: <hi>God hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not ſinners,</hi> that is, God doth not reſpect the <pb n="71" facs="tcp:21717:40"/>prayer of ſinners, which perſiſt in any ſinne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repenting and reforming themſelues; nor is it reaſon that he ſhould care to fulfill their deſires, who haue no care to fulfill his Lawes. But <hi>if any man be a worſhipper of God, and doth his will, &amp;c.</hi> That is, if any man endeuour to ſerue God, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking ſinne, and performing good duties, GOD heareth that mans prayer, and will not deny him any requeſt, that may be for his good. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we may conſider in this ſaying, the certainty and vndoubted truth of it: <hi>We know,</hi> (ſaith he:) he ſaith not, <hi>we thinke,</hi> or <hi>we hope,</hi> or
<hi>we are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> of it; but we know it, as a thing that is cleere and out of queſtion. Againe, <hi>Wee know;</hi> he doth not ſay, <hi>I know,</hi> or <hi>you know,</hi> or the <hi>learned</hi> Doctors know; but
<hi>Wee,</hi> I, and you, and all doe agree in this principle, That God reiecteth the prayers of ſinners, but
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Pſal. 34.13.</note> 
                  <hi>his eares are open to the cry of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: and,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Pſ. 145.19.</note> he will fulfill the deſire of them that feare him: he alſo will heare their cry and will ſaue them.</hi> And if amendment of life and practice of righteouſnes be ſo powerfull with God, then fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting rightly vſed, cannot want his effect.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe faſting rightly vſed, is a meanes to
<hi>eleuate</hi> the minde, and to enflame a zeale and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and to ſet an edge on our prayers, as was formerly declared. But
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Iam. 5.10.</note> 
                  <hi>the effectuall feruent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a righteous man auaileth much,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. And conſequently, faſting is a good meanes to impetrate grace and fauour.</p>
               <p>In theſe and ſuch like reſpects, faſting may ſteed vs with God, to incline him to our prayers. And <pb n="72" facs="tcp:21717:41"/>therefore God himſelf reprouing the ill-gouern'd Faſts of the Iewes,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iſa. 58.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye ſhall not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>faſt, as yee doe this day, to make your voyce to bee heard on high.</hi> Where he ſignifieth, that their ill handling of their Faſts, was the cauſe that their prayers were not heard; and implyeth withall, that a right and well-ordered Faſt would haue pierced the clouds, and obtained audience in heauen.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Secondly and more particularly, it may ſerue vs to obtaine fauour and mercy in theſe and ſuch like ſpeciall caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If a man ſtand guiltie of ſinne, and lyable to Gods anger, faſting may ſerue to appeaſe Gods anger, and to obtaine pardon of the ſinne. This end <hi>Ezrah</hi> had of his faſting. For when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had ſinned in taking ſtrange wiues, firſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the ſinne,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ezra 9.15. &amp; 10.1.</note>
                  <hi>Behold, O Lord God of Iſrael, we are before thee in our treſpaſſes: for wee cannot ſtand before thee becauſe of this.</hi> And ſecondly, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke himſelfe to abſtinence and faſting.
<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ezra 10.6.</note> 
                  <hi>He did cate no bread, nor drinke water: for he mourned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the tranſgreſsion of them that had beene car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away.</hi> And laſtly,
<note n="(d)" place="margin">verſ. 19.</note> he tooke order that they did both <hi>put away their wiues, and being guiltie, did offer a Ram of the flocke for their treſpaſſe.</hi> In which practice of this holy man, it appeareth, that faſting was one meanes, by which he ſought pardon for the ſinne. And to like purpoſe, the Lord himſelfe appointed the Iewes, to ioyne faſting with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ioel 2.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Turne ye vnto me with all your heart,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and with faſting, and with weeping and with mourning, and rent your hearts, &amp;c. For he is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:21717:41"/>and mercifull, &amp;c.</hi> And for this cauſe, ſome of the Learned ſay, that
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Act. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> did faſt and pray for three dayes ſpace, that he might obtaine pardon for his former ſinnes committed before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If a man be lyable to Gods Iudgements, and eyther be vnder the ſenſe of ſome preſent croſſe, or in feare of ſome future euill; faſting is a good meanes to preuent the one, and to remoue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Examples heereof wee haue in Scriptures. For of the <hi>Nineuites</hi> we reade, that when GOD had threatned;
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ion. 3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Yet forty dayes, and Nineueh ſhall be ouer throwne: they beleeued God, and proclaimed a Faſt, and put on ſack-cloth,</hi> and ſo they
<note n="(c)" place="margin">verſ. vlt.</note> preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the iudgement. And <hi>Ichoſaphat,</hi> when he and his people were in great danger by reaſon of a great Armie of Moabites and Ammonites that came againſt them;
<note n="(d)" place="margin">2 Chro. 20.2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>he feared, and ſet himſelfe to ſeeke the Lord, and he proclaimed a Faſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Iudah:</hi> and by this meanes
<note n="(e)" place="margin">v. 15, 22, &amp;c</note> hee eſcaped the danger. And <hi>Dauid,</hi> when his child was ſicke and in danger of death,
<note n="(f)" place="margin">2 Sam. 12.16.</note> 
                  <hi>he faſted,</hi> and prayed for his life. And though God ſaw it not good at that time to ſpare the childs life: yet by this it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that
<hi>Dauid</hi> knew faſting and prayer to be an ordinary and effectuall meanes to auert Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or elſe hee would not haue vſed it. Yea, and ſo powerfull is faſting for this purpoſe, that
<note n="(g)" place="margin">1. King. 21.27, 29.</note>
                  <hi>Ahab</hi> by his, though no ſound faſting, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent a worldly iudgement. And our Sauiour tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs,
<note n="(h)" place="margin">Mat. 17.21.</note> that there are ſome ſuch diuels as cannot be caſt out of the poſſeſſed, <hi>but by prayer &amp; faſting:</hi> 
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:21717:42"/>aſſuring vs heereby, that when no other meanes can, yet prayer and faſting may preuaile.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a man haue neede of ſome ſpeciall bleſſing or merey from God, faſting is a good meanes to obtaine it. This may be declared by the example of <hi>Ezrah.</hi> For he and his Country-men, the men of <hi>Iudah,</hi> were to goe vp to <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> from
<hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> the place of their captiuity, and many lets they found in the way, and little help for ſo great a iourney: and heereupon,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ezra. 8.21.</note> 
                  <hi>I proclaimed a Faſt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that we might afflict our ſelues before our God, to ſeeke of him a right way for vs, and for our little ones, and for all our ſubſtance.</hi> Where we may note, that the thing which hee deſired, was, that God would direct them and leade them <hi>in a right way</hi> in ſafety and without danger: and the means that he vſed to obtaine this, was faſting. The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe whereof what it was, is declared afterward, where <hi>Ezrah</hi> ſaith,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">verſ. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>So we faſted, and beſought our God for this, and hee was entreated by vs.</hi> And to like purpoſe it is, that the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> when they were to ſend
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> about the worke of the Miniſtery and preaching of the Goſpell,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Act. 13.3.</note> 
                  <hi>they faſted and prayed, and layed their hands on them;</hi> and ſo ſent them about the worke. Yea and our
<note n="(d)" place="margin">Mar. 4.2.</note> Lord himſelfe, being to enter vpon his Propheticall office, began with faſting, and thereby prepared himſelf for that glorious worke, as may appeare hereafter more fully in the proper place. By all which we may ſee what commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and benefits we may reape by this exerciſe, not onely for our ſoules &amp; our ſpirituall profit, but <pb n="75" facs="tcp:21717:42"/>for our bodies alſo, and our welfare in the world. And hence, for concluſion of this poynt, I deduce and inferre three Aduertiſements for our further vſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may hence obſerue one ſpeciall reaſon, why we are many times afflicted, and after long griefe finde little eaſe: and it may be, becauſe we do not repent of our ſinnes before we beg mercy; or if we vſe ſome kinde of repentance, yet it is not with that ſorrow, &amp; ſuch chaſtening of our ſelues, as God doth expect, and the caſe doth require. For in Scriptures we finde that Gods people, if eyther they felt any preſent ſcourge, or feared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny future danger, then they betooke themſelues preſently to their prayers, and faſting, and ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth: and by this meanes they haue gotten vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ouer enemies, and reliefe in time of dearth, and freedome from intended miſchiefes, and caſe and comfort in all caſes of diſtreſſe. And if wee ſhould vſe the ſame meanes, why might wee not expect the ſame ſucceſſe? For the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 4.23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>that it was imputed to him for righteouſnes,</hi> addeth, that <hi>it was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed to him; but for vs alſo, to whom it ſhall be imputed, if we beleeue on him that raiſed vp Ieſus our Lord from the dead.</hi> And elſewhere he ſaith of the many examples of Gods Iudgements vpon ſinners, that
<note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.6, 11.</note> 
                  <hi>theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them for examples, and are written for our admonition, that we ſhould not luſt after euill things, as they luſted.</hi> And ſo, ſeeing ſuch things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scriptures concerning Faſting; wee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21717:43"/>may and muſt conclude, that <hi>theſe things were not written</hi> for thoſe ancient ſeruants of God onely, that they by this meanes obtained ſuch great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; but for our ſakes alſo, and to admoniſh vs, that if we vſe the ſame meanes, we ſhall attaine the ſame end. And therefore, if any of vs haue beene long afflicted, and yet are not deliuered; let vs conſider whether we haue not beene defectiue in this dutie, and for want of <hi>humiliation</hi> haue miſſed of the bleſſing. Surely, if we find not eaſe, eyther we haue not humbled our ſelues as we ſhould, or the thing that we deſire, is no ſuch bleſſing to vs, as wee doe imagine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may from hence learne, how to make our prayers powerfull with God. For God hath appointed vs to aske, and hath tyed himſelfe to giue, but it is vpon condition, that we
<note n="(a)" place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.14.</note> 
                  <hi>aske accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his will,</hi> and in ſuch ſort as we ought to aske. For
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Iam. 4.3.</note> 
                  <hi>ye aske &amp; receiue not, becauſe ye aske amiſſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. But what is that condition that God requireth in our prayers? And how may wee aske, that we <hi>miſſe</hi> not of our requeſts? Why? ſurely, one meanes that may make all our prayers the more effectuall, is, if they be feruent and with feeling: and one condition, on which God doth grant ſome petitions, is, if they proceede from a ſoule humbled with faſting. For as our Lord ſaith, that there is a kinde of Diuels that cannot bee driuen out <hi>but by prayer and faſting:</hi> ſo I may ſay, that ſome ſinnes may be pardoned, and ſome iudgements auerted, and ſome bleſſings obtained by prayer ioyned with ordinary humiliation and <pb n="77" facs="tcp:21717:43"/>repentance: (for it cannot be expected that wee ſhould faſt ſo often as we may and ought to pray) yet ſome ſinnes there may be of ſo deepe a dye, that ordinary ſorrow may not be admitted for their expiation: and ſome bleſſings there may be of that worth, and of that importance, that they may ſeeme too lightly eſteemed, if they were too eaſily obtayned. And of ſuch I may ſay, theſe kinds of ſinnes are not pardoned, and theſe kinds of bleſſings are not obtayned but <hi>by prayer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</hi> And if the pardon of greater ſinnes, and the purchaſe of greater gifts bee to be ſought for by prayer and faſting: then in the leſſer of them we ſhall ſpeede the ſooner, if we come in the ſame manner. If then wee deſire to make our prayers powerfull, and to pierce the heauens; we muſt help to liſt them vp with this wing of faſting, as the Fathers call it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may hence gather, how neceſſary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting is for all ſorts, and at all times; and in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall for our ſelues in theſe dayes. For, to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the ſpirituall helps that it hath for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace and deuotion, (which alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould moue any Chriſtian, if not to be in loue with it, yet at leaſt to giue way to it) and to inſiſt only in the further bleſſings now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: who is there, that is not priuie to himſelfe of ſome ſinne, which without pardon may be his ruine? And who is there, that either doth not now ſuffer, or may not iuſtly feare ſome iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereafter, which hee would gladly preuent or auoyd? And againe, who is there that doth <pb n="78" facs="tcp:21717:44"/>not want and deſire ſome bleſſing &amp; gift of God, that may greatly concerne his body, or his ſoule, or his eſtate? But if any man be ſo happy, as to haue need of none of theſe mercies; or rather ſo vnhappy, as not to feele &amp; know that he hath need of them all, or at leaſt many of them: yet if wee looke abroad vpon the face of the Chriſtian world, wee may ſee many of our brethren that ſerue the ſame Lord, robbed of their goods, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their liberty, &amp; butchered in their own dwellings: yea and many houſes burned downe, Townes laid waſte, fields left vntilled, and ſtreets and high-wayes ſwimming in bloud, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring al other miſeries, which the cruelty of bloody warres, and inſolency of proud Conquerers doe vſe to bring with them. And beſide all this, who can tell whoſe turne is next, and at whoſe doore the Trumpet may blow? <hi>Quis talia fando temperet à lachrymis?</hi> A compaſsionate Chriſtian cannot thinke on this, without watery eyes and a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart.

               </p>
               <p>And firſt, Why our Lord did faſt at this time,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:21717:45"/>I finde nothing expreſly ſaid in the Text: but by conſidering the circumſtances of Chriſts faſt, and by comparing other Scriptures with this Text, wee may conceiue diuers reaſons of his ſo doing, which will be profitable for vs to take notice of: which ſo far as I do now apprehend, may be theſe</p>
               <p n="1">I. Firſt, wee may well thinke that he faſted, that hereby he might performe a part of that <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and thoſe ſufferings which hee voluntarily vndertooke for our ſakes. For our Lord beeing equall with God, and farre aboue the infirmities of our nature,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Philip. 2.6, 7, 8.</note> 
                  <hi>tooke vpon him the forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,</hi> and <hi>humbled himſelfe euen vnto death.</hi> In which his humiliation, there be diuers ſteps and degrees. For the laſt and greateſt, and that which is the perfection of all, was his death and paſſion vpon the Croſſe: and yet his meane birth, his poore eſtate, his reproches in the world, his want of things neceſſary, his debilities of nature, and other ſuch infirmities and wants, were all of them as preparatiues to his death, and parts of thoſe ſufferings which hee ſuſtained for our ſinnes. For which cauſe it is, that the Apoſtle doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 5.8.</note> 
                  <hi>hee dyed for vs;</hi> but ſaith alſo that
<note n="(c)" place="margin">2 Cor. 8.9.</note> 
                  <hi>hee beeing rich, became poore for our ſakes.</hi> And ſo by the ſame reaſon, wee may ſay that he being God, became man for our ſakes; and being ſtrong, became weake for our ſakes; and being glorious, became contemptible for our ſakes; and beeing Lord of all, became deſtitute of all things for our ſakes: And ſo in like ſort, hee ſweat, and feared, and faſted, and thirſted, and hungred; and all for <pb n="81" facs="tcp:21717:45"/>our ſakes. And therefore of his faſting (the thing that is proper to this place) the Church ſpeaketh thus in her prayers:
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Collect on the firſt Sunday in Lent.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord, which for our ſakes didſt faſt forty dayes and forty nights.</hi> This then I take to be one reaſon; He therefore faſted in this manner, and the rather perhaps at this time, when he was in more ſpeciall manner to goe about the worke of our ſaluation; becauſe it was a part of thoſe ſufferings, which hee did vndergoe for our ſakes.</p>
               <p>Where, by the way, we may reflect vpon our ſelues, and tell our owne ſoules; that if our Lord did doe all theſe things for <hi>our ſakes,</hi> wee ſhould not thinke much to doe a little for <hi>his ſake:</hi> but more eſpecially, ſeeing hee faſted ſo many dayes and nights for vs; wee ſhould not grudge to faſt a little now and then for him. But how for him? For I ſuppoſe, all men will be ready to ſay, that if they knew they ſhould faſt for <hi>Chriſts ſake,</hi> as hee faſted for ours; that then they would doe it with a good-will, or elſe it were pitty of their liues. To ſuch men, if any ſhall make ſuch demand, my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is; Wee may truly be ſaid to faſt for Chriſts ſake many wayes. As firſt, if we faſt, that we may with more reuerence, and better attention, and greater feruour performe holy dueties vnto him. In which kinde they faſt for Chriſt, who when they come to Church, to heare, and pray, and prayſe God, and to partake of the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſts body, doe forbeare their meate, that they may bee more freſh to attend to thoſe holy dueties, and becauſe they doe preferre Gods <pb n="82" facs="tcp:21717:46"/>ſeruice before their owne neceſſity, and doe loue the Word and the Sacrament more than their <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary food.</hi> Secondly, wee may be ſaid to faſt for Chriſt, if wee faſt, that wee may ſubdue thoſe ſinnes that nayled Chriſt to his Croſſe; and which if wee commit them, doe
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. 6.6.</note> 
                  <hi>crucifie againe the Sonne of God, and make a mocke of him.</hi> And in this kinde they faſt for Chriſt, who forbeare their meat, that they may ſorrow for their ſinnes, and may arme themſelues againſt temptations, and bring vnder their body, that their fleſh doe not wax wanton againſt Chriſt. Thirdly, wee may faſt for Chriſts ſake, if wee forbeare to feed our ſelues, that wee may haue wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue others, who beeing the poore members of Chriſt, haue neede of our ſupply. For what is done to any one of thoſe little ones, is eſteemed as done to Chriſt himſelfe. And ſure, if Chriſt did faſt ſo long, that hee might ſupply vs; it were both ſinne and ſhame, not to forbeare a meale, if need require, that wee may cheriſh Chriſt in his members.</p>
               <p>In this manner, and by theſe meanes, wee may be ſaid to faſt for Chriſt. Let vs make vſe of them in our practice, and wee ſhall hereby ſhew our loue to our Sauiour, as hee by faſting forty dayes for vs, ſhewed his great loue vnto vs.</p>
               <p n="2">II. A ſecond cauſe why our Lord faſted at this time, may be that hee might by this meanes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke Sathan to begin his aſſault. The declaration and proofe of this aſſertion dependeth vpon two things: firſt, that his faſting was a fit occaſion, <pb n="83" facs="tcp:21717:46"/>that might prouoke the Deuill to the on-ſet: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that Chriſt was willing to giue him ſuch an occaſion.</p>
               <p>And firſt, that this was a fit occaſion, appeareth by 2. things. 1. Becauſe when men are in diſtreſſe, then is the Deuils opportunity to tempt them, eyther to diſtruſt God, becauſe hee leaueth them without reliefe; or to vſe vnlawfull meanes, that they may relieue themſelues. 2. Becauſe the euent ſheweth that Chriſts hunger cauſed by his faſting, was the occaſion that Sathan tooke to aſſault him. For when he ſaw him fainting for want of bread, then hee thought it a fit time to ſay, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, command that this ſtone bee made bread.</hi> And what the euent did make manifeſt afterward, that our Lord knew very well before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That our Lord was willing to giue the Deuill ſuch an occaſion to prouoke him to the combat, may appeare by two things alſo. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was Gods will to haue it ſo; as is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by this, that the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of God <hi>led him into the wilderneſse, to be tempted of the Deuill:</hi> and Chriſts will was euer agreeable to the will of his Father.
2. Becauſe Chriſt did ſo thirſt after our ſaluation, that hee refuſed no paynes, nor no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to procure it. Hee left heauen, that he might become man for vs; hee tooke our baſe nature, that hee might beare our infirmities; and he went vp to Ieruſalem, that hee might be crucified; and hee came into the world, that hee might ſaue the world by his ſufferings. And ſo, ſeeing the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <pb n="84" facs="tcp:21717:47"/>of Sathan, by which hee aſſaulted our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, might be profitable for vs, and auaileable for our ſaluation; (for ſo Sathan might be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at his owne weapon, and wee armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his aſſaults afterward:) wee neede not doubt, but as the
<hi>Spirit led Chriſt into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse, to be tempted of the Deuill;</hi> ſo our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would faſt and hunger, that the Deuill might aſſault him.</p>
               <p>And heere againe by the way, a Chriſtian may haue a good meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from his Maſters practice: that ſeeing Chriſt was ready to fight againſt the Deuill for our ſakes; wee ſhould not feare to ſtand out againſt men for his ſake. But if Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion be a cauſe, that wee are queſtioned by Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or diſgraced by worldlings, or kept from preferment by great Ones; wee muſt beare op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of men, for loue to Chriſt; as hee bore theſe temptations of the Deuill, for loue vnto vs.</p>
               <p n="3">III. A third cauſe may be, that by this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of faſting, hee might prepare and fit himſelfe for the great worke that hee was about. For hee was now to enter vpon his Propheticall Office, and to begin the publique function of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. And in this, and ſuch like caſes as this, Gods ſeruants haue vſed to make preparation by faſting and prayers, as may bee ſeene in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Act. 13.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> and
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Act. 14.23.</note> other Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of diuers Churches. And therefore ſeeing our Lord here faſted for a long ſpace, and that at ſuch a time as he was to enter vpon the miniſtery
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21717:47"/>of the Goſpell; we may well thinke that this is one reaſon of his faſting, that hee might prepare himſelfe for this great ſeruice. Onely the doubt may be; But what needed our Lord any ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration? For 1. hee was not defectiue in any grace. For <hi>God
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ioh. 3.34.</note> gaue not the ſpirit to him by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:</hi> but <hi>he was
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ioha. 14.</note> full of grace and truth.</hi> 2. Our Lord was an innocent
<note n="(c)" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Lambe, without blemiſh and without ſpot.</hi> And what needed hee ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiue helps, that had all grace, and no ſinne?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, there be three reaſons hereof. Firſt, that he might ſtirre vp, and inflame, and (as yee would ſay) actuate the grace which he had already. To this purpoſe it is, that when hee was to pray, he
<note n="(d)" place="margin">Mat. 14.23.</note> 
                  <hi>went into a mountaine,</hi> or ſome other priuate place <hi>alone,</hi> [<hi>ardentioris orationis cauſâ,</hi>] <hi>that he might pray the more feruently,</hi> ſay the Learned. And ſo againe, when he was to raiſe vp <hi>La Zarus,
<note n="(e)" place="margin">Ioh. 11.33.</note> he groaned, and was troubled. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he troubled himſelfe,</hi> that is, he ſtirred vp his ſorrow, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his bowels vnto compaſſion and pitty. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he might confirme and radicate, and, I thinke I may ſay, that he might in ſome fort increaſe the graces that he had. For the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſay, that he tooke vpon him our infirmities,
<note n="(f)" place="margin">Heb. 2.17.18</note> 
                  <hi>that he might be a mercifull and faithful High-prieſt:</hi> and that
<note n="(g)" place="margin">Heb. 5.8.</note> 
                  <hi>he learned obedience by that which hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:</hi> and that
<note n="(h)" place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> 
                  <hi>he endured the Croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame, for the ioy that was ſet before him:</hi> and that in his greateſt ſorrow,
<note place="margin">Luk. 22.43.</note> 
                  <hi>an Angel came to ſtrengthen him.</hi> By which ſpeeches we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that his feeling of our wants, and his bearing <pb n="86" facs="tcp:21717:48"/>of afflictions, and his conſideration of future ioyes, and the prefence and conference of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, did <hi>increaſe or confirme</hi> his compaſſion toward vs, and his obedience to his Father, and his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and his courage in his conflicts: or elſe I know not what they meane, and whereto they ſerue. And if they intend thus much, then by the ſame reaſon we may ſay, that his praying and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meditating might ſerue to increaſe or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme or preſerue the graces of the ſpirit, which did enable him for his office. Thirdly, hee vſed this preparation, that he might obtaine a bleſſing vpon his labours, that they might become profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Hearers. For ſo we reade, that he ſtill vſed to commend buſineſſes to Gods bleſſing. When he fed the people,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 14.19.</note> he <hi>looked vp to heauen, and bleſsed, and brake, and gaue them, &amp;c.</hi> that is, He prayed for a bleſsing vpon the meat: and ſo, when he conſecrated the Sacrament,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Mat. 26.26.</note> 
                  <hi>he bleſſed it.</hi> And when he was to leaue the world, and to ſend his Diſciples to ſupply his place of preaching,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ioh. 17.20.</note> hee <hi>prayed not only</hi> for the Preachers, but <hi>for them alſo that ſhould beleeue through their word.</hi> And ſo, it is reaſonable alſo to thinke, that Chriſt did now faſt and pray for a bleſsing vpon the word, that hee was to preach, and vpon the people to whom hee was to preach. Thus in diuers good reſpects, our Lord might vſe his faſting for a preparation, to fit him for his publike office: and becauſe we cannot conceiue that our Lord would omit an exerciſe ſo good and ſo proper for his preſent occaſion; we may wel ſuppoſe that one cauſe of his faſting was, <pb n="87" facs="tcp:21717:48"/>to prepare himſelfe for this great ſeruice of his Miniſtery.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. A fourth and laſt cauſe why Chriſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted heere, may bee, that he might giue vs an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample by his owne practice. For as a wiſe and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Phyſician will ſometime iuſte the Phyſicke which he preſcribeth, that he may encourage his patient to take it: ſo our Lord vpon occaſion did many things for our example. So the Apoſtle ſaith, Chriſt
<note n="(a)" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.21.</note> 
                  <hi>ſuffered for vs, leauing vs an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi> And when our Lord had waſhed his Diſciples feete, himſelfe telleth them his reaſon;
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ioh. 13.15.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue giuen you an example</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ye ſhould doe, as I haue done vnto you.</hi> And ſo ſeeing he vſed faſting heere, before the entrance of his publike ſeruice and calling, he might doe it for this reaſon among others; that he might leaue vs an example, vpon the like occaſion to vſe the like practice.</p>
               <p>And from hence we haue two concluſions, that may further commend the holy vſe of a religious Faſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That an holy Faſt is a good exerciſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin our Callings &amp; all important buſineſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. For not onely
<hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was to receiue the Law; and <hi>Elias,</hi> when he was to reſtore the Law; but Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, when he was to perfect the Law, did faſt and pray, before they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke the worke; and ſo if any of vs be to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon a calling, or to vndergoe ſome great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; if for example, we be called to bee Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, or are to enter vpon the ſtate of marriage, <pb n="86" facs="tcp:21717:49"/> 
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:21717:50"/>or to begin a trade or profeſſion in the world, or to vndertake any waighty matter; it is a good rule (and we haue good authority for it) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate our entrance by an holy Faſt. And ſure I am perſwaded, it is one great cauſe, that we haue oftentimes ſo little comfort in the execution of our places, becauſe we vſe ſo little Religion in our entrance into them. But if wee would follow Chriſts ſteps, we might hope for his bleſſing to direct vs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That an holy Faſt hath a proper vſe in the conſecrating and ordayning of Miniſters for the ſeruice of the Church. Our Lord vſed it heere, when he was conſecrated and appointed for his Miniſtery; and the Apoſtolicall Church by his example vſed it, when
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elders, were to be ſent abroad for preaching of the Goſpell: and the Chriſtian Church after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, haue appointed the foure ſolemn times of faſting to be the ſet and ſolemn times for giuing of Orders, and for ſending of Miniſters into the Church. And their warrant is Chriſts example, and the practice of the Apoſtles and the Apoſtolicall Church. The common neglect of which times, and this holy exerciſe to be vſed at thoſe times and for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, may bee one reaſon, why the Church is not better prouided of Teachers, and the people are not more profited by their labours. For redreſſe whereof, it were to be wiſhed, that publike Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority would appoint ſome publike meetings at thoſe times, that by faſting and prayer we might <pb n="89" facs="tcp:21717:50"/>commend that great worke to Gods bleſſing with one conſent of heart. But becauſe it is not in the power of priuate men, to make publike orders; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Chriſtian ſhall doe well in his deuotions at home, by faſting and Prayer to begge a bleſſing on that ſacred worke: that God would direct the Fathers of our Church, to admit fit men to that ſacred function, and would enable the then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Miniſters, to profit the Church by their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and would ſanctifie all, to make vſe of his Word, and the publike Miniſtery, while we haue it, and doe enioy it.</p>

<hi>dayes</hi> and ſo many <hi>nights.</hi> And the reaſon is the ſame, becauſe if a man be blind for ſo many <hi>dayes,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceiued that he had his ſight in the night time. In theſe &amp; ſuch like caſes, the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the things is ſuch, that what is ſaid of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the <hi>day,</hi> muſt be taken for the <hi>night</hi> too. And in ſuch caſes, there is no neede to mention the nights. But yet ſometimes, as when the ſpeech is of ſuch things, which though they happen in the
<hi>day,</hi> yet are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be intermitted in the <hi>night,</hi> then the name of the <hi>dayes</hi> doth not include the night alſo: As when it is ſaid of <hi>Laban,</hi> that he purſued after <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Gen. 31.23.</note> ſeuen dayes iourney:</hi> the meaning is, he follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed ſo farre, as a man may, or doth vſe to goe in <pb n="91" facs="tcp:21717:51"/>the ſpace of ſeuen <hi>dayes,</hi> not counting the <hi>nights,</hi> becauſe men that trauell by <hi>day,</hi> are ſuppoſed to take vp their lodging, and reſt in the <hi>night</hi> time. And ſo, if a man ſhould hire an ordinary day-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer to worke with him for two or three daies, all men would vnderſtand the bargaine to be made of working in the <hi>day,</hi> and not in the <hi>night</hi> time: but if a Mariner ſhould bee hyred to labour in a ſhip by ſea, or a nurſe to attend a ſicke partie for the ſame number of dayes, euery man would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue that both of <hi>day</hi> and <hi>night;</hi> becauſe ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and paines as the mariner and nurſe do take in ſuch caſes, are to be continued aſwell by <hi>night</hi> as by <hi>day.</hi> Now when the ſpeech is of ſuch things, as being done in the day, may be intermitted, or vſe to be intermitted by night, then the name of dayes doth not include or comprize the nights alſo. And ſo it falleth out in this matter of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For when the Iewes were to faſt for many dayes together, their maner was to abſtaine from meate all the day,
<note place="margin">Chap. 1. p. 7, 8.</note> but at night to eate a ſparing meale; as I haue declared in another place alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And hereupon the Learned doe obſerue, that the Iewes, when they ſpeake of <hi>many dayes Faſt,</hi> without mentioning the nights, they vnderſtand it commonly of faſting onely in the day time, till euening: and that when they meane that a Faſt is continued for diuers dayes, without eating any thing at night, then for diſtinction ſake, and that their meaning may be plaine, they adde the nights too; as when <hi>Eſter</hi> ſaith to the Iewes,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Eſter 4.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Faſt ye for me, and neither eate nor drinke three dayes, night <pb n="92" facs="tcp:21717:52"/>or day.</hi> And ſo in this place, Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith, that
<hi>Chriſt faſted forty dayes and forty nights,</hi> leſt any man ſhould conceiue, that hee abſtained all day for that ſpace, but did refreſh himſelfe in the euening.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond queſtion is, Why our Lord made choyce of this number of <hi>fortie,</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his faſting by. This queſtion may admit two conſtructions, and ſo receiue two anſwers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. For firſt it may be vnderſtood of the preciſe number of
<hi>fortie,</hi> why iuſt ſo many dayes, without miſſing, either vnder or ouer. Or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may be meant of an extraordinary number of dayes, and ſpace of time, that is, why hee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſo many dayes and nights, as it exceedeth mans ſtrength to endure without eating.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If wee take it in the former ſenſe, then I thinke I may ſafely ſay, as many of the Learned doe, that our Lord did make choyce of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of dayes, that hee might therein conforme himſelfe to the two great Prophets of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> For
<hi>Moſes</hi> was the giuer of the Law, and <hi>Elias</hi> was the reſtorer of the Law; and both were in their kinde, the moſt excellent Prophets that the old Church had: and both of them, for the confirmation of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and to gaine credit to their places, did faſt <hi>forty dayes</hi> and <hi>forty nights,</hi> when they were to ſpeake with God in the Mount, as it is recorded of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 34.28. <hi>Deut.</hi>
9.9. and of <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.8.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21717:52"/>and that they did conſent and agree with him, thought good to begin his Miniſtery, as they did theirs, with a miraculous Faſt of
<hi>forty dayes.</hi> To which purpoſe wee likewiſe reade, that when our Lord was <hi>transfigured</hi> in the Mount,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matt. 17.3. &amp; Luk. 9.30.31.</note>
                  <hi>Moſes and Elias appeared vnto him, and talked with him, and ſpake of his death</hi> and paſſion. And this did ſerue for a cleare confirmation of Chriſts calling and authority, that theſe two ſpeciall and principall Prophets did both concurre to beare witneſſe of him: and hereby it appeared, that the Goſpell had <hi>witneſse of the Law and the Prophets,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21.</p>
               <p>But then the queſtion may be further, Why did <hi>Moſes</hi> faſt <hi>forty dayes and forty nights,</hi> and that at two ſeuerall times, when he was with God in the Mount? And hereto I anſwere, that many both ancient and moderne Writers, eſpecially thoſe that be in the Church of Rome, doe ſay that there was a <hi>myſtery</hi> in this number; and that that was the reaſon why both <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and our Sauiour alſo did faſt that ſpace of time: but eyther they ſay not what that myſtery was, or elſe they proue not what they ſay: nay, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues cannot agree what to ſay. For ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the myſtery one way, and ſome another, as euery mans ſeuerall fancy doth leade him: the relation of which ſundry conceits, would be more tedious than profitable. But to the poynt it ſelfe, for my part I haue onely two things to ſay. 1. That though I will not peremptorily condemne their opinion who conceiue a
<hi>myſtery</hi> in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; <pb n="94" facs="tcp:21717:53"/>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">

<hi>forty,</hi> as ſay 39, or 41 might not haue fitted this occaſion as well.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that it is not vnlikely, but that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further myſtery, God onely intended <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> and Chriſt to faſt ſo long, as beeing aboue the ſtrength of man, it might appeare that they were ſuſtayned by the power of God, and that therefore their calling and office was from heauen. Now for this purpoſe, the wiſdome of God did ſee ſuch a continuance of time, as about <hi>forty dayes,</hi> to be both ſufficient and conuenient: and becauſe forty is the round number, and as fit as any other, did make choyce of that, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this abſtinence by. This I take to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; but I preſume not to affirme any thing: nor will I be curious to enquire into that, which God hath not reuealed. And ſo I leaue the firſt ſenſe of the queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If wee take it in the latter, as importing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a long abſtinence which exceedeth the power of nature, then the queſtion is, Why our Sauiour would faſt ſo long, and in ſuch a miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Hereof there may be giuen two plaine and apparant reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt reaſon may be, that by his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Faſt hee might proue his calling, and the <pb n="95" facs="tcp:21717:53"/>truth of his doctrine. For ſeeing he faſted aboue the ſtrength of nature, it muſt needes follow that he did it by the power of God. And God would not aſſiſt him with a miraculous power in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of his Office, vnleſſe himſelfe did approue and allow of his calling. The further declaration of which reaſon may be ſeene in a like example of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> For when <hi>Moſes</hi> made ſcruple of going to the Iſraelites with Gods meſſage, becauſe hee feared leſt they would not beleeue that God had ſent him: God armeth him with a power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, that hereby hee might conuince and perſwade them. And
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Exod. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>If</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>they will not beleeue thee, nor hearken to the voyce of the firſt ſigne; yet they will beleeue the voyce of the later ſigne.</hi> Where wee may note two things. Firſt, that the end of theſe miracles was to credit
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his Miniſtery, and to make the people beleeue him. Secondly, that theſe miraculous workes haue <hi>a voyce,</hi> whereby they ſpeake vnto men; <hi>If</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>they will not hearken to the voyce of the firſt ſigne.</hi> But what <hi>voyce</hi> is that? and how do theſe dumbe ſignes ſpeake? Sure, they ſay and ſpeake, or rather proclaime it with an <hi>audible voyce,</hi> that hee who doth theſe workes, hath the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit to worke them. For
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Ioh. 3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>no man</hi> (as ſaith <hi>Nicodemus</hi>) <hi>can doe theſe miracles that thou doeſt, except GOD be with him.</hi> And,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ioh. 9.33.</note> 
                  <hi>If this man were not of God</hi> (ſaith the blind man now conuerted) <hi>hee could doe nothing;</hi> that is, he could doe nothing in this miraculous manner. Theſe miracles then of <hi>Moſes</hi> were as ſo many ſhrill <hi>voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:21717:54"/>or lowd-ſounding cryes from heauen, which proclaymed in the eares of all men, <hi>This man is of God, and the Lord is with him.</hi> And ſo vpon the ſame ground, our Lord proueth his calling by his miracles.
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ioh. 10.37, 38.</note> 
                  <hi>If</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I doe not the workes of my Father, beleeue mee not. But if I doe, though yee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not mee, beleeue the workes.</hi> And if Chriſt and
<hi>Moſes</hi> did proue their callings to bee from God, by the miraculous workes that God wrought by them: what ſhould let vs to thinke, but ſeeing Chriſt in the very entrance of his Office did vſe a miraculous Faſt, that hee therefore did it to proue that hee was ſent from God, and did preach that truth that God had taught him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond reaſon of this long faſting in our Sauiour, may be, becauſe before ſo extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a worke as hee was then to enter vpon, hee thought fit to vſe an extraordinary preparation, ſuch as this long faſting might ſerue for. For that he now faſted to prepare himſelfe for his publike Office, I haue declared already in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and that extraordinary occaſions doe require extraordinary preparations, may appeare by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of Scriptures. For we reade, that when the people were to ſerue God at ordinary times of deuotion, an ordinary preparation ſufficed, ſuch as that which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaketh of,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Keepe thy foote when thou goeſt to the Houſe of God, and bee more ready to heare than to giue the ſacrifice of fooles:</hi> and that which our Sauiour requireth,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Luk. 8.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Take heed how yee heare.</hi> But when they were to receiue the Law from Gods owne mouth, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21717:54"/>to heare him ſpeaking in Maieſty, with thundring and lightning and trumpets; then God appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that they ſhould be prepared
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Exod. 19.10, 15.</note> for two whole dayes together, and commandeth that <hi>they waſh their clothes, and abſtaine from their wiues.</hi> And when they were to eate the Paſſeouer, they were to
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Exod. 12.3, 6.</note> prepare the Lambe, and to fit themſelues for it foure dayes before. And when
<hi>Moſes</hi> was to goe vp to God into the Mount,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Exod. 24.16, 18.</note> hee ſtayed ſixe dayes in the ſide of the Mount, before hee was admitted to ſpeake with God: and hee <hi>ſtayed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dayes</hi> in all, before hee could receiue the two Tables, and bring the Law to the people. All which time, we cannot imagine eyther that hee was idle, or buſied about impertinent affaires that concerned not that occaſion: yea, and Scriptures do ſay, that for that time, he
<note n="(d)" place="margin">Deut. 9.9, 18.</note> exerciſed himſelfe in <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>faſting.</hi> And ſo in like ſort, ſeeing our Lord was to enter vpon the greateſt worke and office that euer man went about; the preaching of the Goſpell to all the world, the oppoſing of the Deuill and euill men, and the redeeming of mankinde by his owne bloud: it is not vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to thinke that hee would make his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion anſwerable to his worke, and extend his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting beyond an ordinary and vſuall time. And becauſe God did enable him with a miraculous power to hold out for <hi>forty dayes,</hi> he was willing to vndergoe it all the while, though in the meane time hee defrauded nature of her vſuall comfort and refreſhing.</p>
               <p>And hence we haue this note for our further <pb n="98" facs="tcp:21717:55"/>direction in this exerciſe, that as faſting ſerueth for many good vſes in Religion; ſo longer time of abſtinence and more ſtrict faſting and greater humiliation is requiſit, when there is any more than ordinary or vſuall occaſion. And ſo the old people of God were wont to doe. For vpon or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaſions, they vſed to faſt one day from morning till night: but vpon extraordinary for a longer ſpace. Thus <hi>Eſter,</hi> when a weighty buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was in hand that concerned her life, and the liues of her people; ſhe appoynted a Faſt for <hi>three dayes and three nights.</hi> And the men of Iabeſh Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, when they had a great cauſe of heauineſſe by the death of <hi>Saul,</hi> and the ouerthrow of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they <hi>faſted for ſeuen dayes ſpace.</hi> And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> when the Church was diſtreſſed, and in great calamity, hee <hi>faſted for three weekes</hi> together. And ſo wee ſhould extend our faſt, and keepe it with more ſtrict obſeruation, and ſet more time apart for holy exerciſes; when either we are about ſome weighty buſineſſe, or be in ſome great danger, or haue fallen into ſome hainous ſinne, or haue a ſpeciall cauſe to remember &amp; celebrate the pangs and paſſion of our Sauiour, or happen vpon ſome other occaſion of more than ordinary ſorrow. Thus, what-euer our occaſions be, faſting is ſtill of vſe in the life of a Chriſtian: if the occaſion be ordinary, ordinary faſting is a fitting exerciſe ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to auert euill, or procure good; and if the occaſion be extraordinary, then as the other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of Religion, ſo this among the reſt, is to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a more than ordinary meaſure.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Oncerning the Faſt of our Sauiour it is recorded, that hee then faſted, when hee was to encounter with Satan, and goe about his publique Miniſtery, and to begin the great worke of our Redemption: and vpon ſuch vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent occaſions, and when there is ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cauſe offered; all men grant that then wee alſo may and ought to faſt for the ſpeedier pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of Gods fauour.

And this is a queſtion doubted of by ſome in our Church, and diſputed with arguments and reaſons on both ſides. For clearing which doubt, wee are firſt of all to declare the meaning of the queſtion; and that may appeare by theſe two notes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſome there be which commend faſting for a religious exerciſe, if it bee vſed onely then, when men ſhall vpon ſeuerall occaſions ſee it to be conuenient; but any ſtanding dayes, whether appoynted by publique authoritie, or vndertaken by a mans owne priuate deuotion, theſe they vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemne as ſuperſtitious and Monkiſh.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21717:56"/>For example, When <hi>Ionas</hi> prophecied of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Nineueh,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ion. 3.6, 7.</note> the King
<hi>proclaymed a faſt,</hi> and the people obſerued it. And this they approue of, and allow our Magiſtrates vpon ſuch an occaſion to doe the like. Againe, when
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Nehem. 1.3, 4.</note>
                  <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> heard that the Iewes were <hi>in great afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reproch;</hi> and that the <hi>wall of Ieruſalem was broken downe, and the gates thereof burnt with fire: he ſate downe and wept, and mourned certaine daies, and faſted.</hi> And this they approue of, and allow euery priuate Chriſtian by his example, vpon ſuch occaſions as theſe, to faſt out of his owne deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But now further, the ancient Chriſtian Church, in remembrance of Chriſts death on that day, did appoynt euery <hi>Fryday</hi> to bee kept faſting-day; and for the ſame and ſome other reaſons, they appoynted the time of <hi>Lent,</hi> as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it ſhould happen, to be obſerued with <hi>abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> and <hi>faſting.</hi> And theſe and ſuch like ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſet-times they allow not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Wee muſt note that the obſeruing and appoynting of theſe dayes may be meant and vnderſtood two wayes; eyther with opinion of
<hi>neceſsitie</hi> or <hi>ſanctitie</hi> in thoſe times, more than in other. And this is not here queſtioned; nor doe wee doubt but the Church, as it appoynted the <hi>Fryday,</hi> ſo if it had pleaſed, might haue appointed any other day for this exerciſe: nor do we thinke that there is any peculiar <hi>ſanctitie</hi> in that day more than in others. Or elſe the queſtion may bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the <hi>lawfulneſse</hi> and conueniency of appoynting ſuch ſet dayes and times, for <hi>order</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:21717:56"/>ſake, and for the more conſtant performance of this worke. And this is it, which we meane in this queſtion.</p>
               <p>The queſtion then is, Whether it be lawfull for Authority to preſcribe, or for priuate men to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſet and ſtanding dayes for faſting; that it may be obſerued the more ordetly and the more conſtantly? And mine anſwere is, That it is both lawfull and expedient for Gouernours to enioyne their Inferiours, and for priuate men to preſcribe vnto themſelues ſuch ſtanding times, ſo often as they ſhall fall, either weekely, or monethly, or yeerely, as they ſee it expedient. And my proofes are, ſome from Scriptures, ſome from examples, and ſome from reaſon grounded on Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">I. From Scriptures. And thence I alledge two places for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16. For there God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>the tenth day of the ſeuenth moneth</hi> to bee kept for a faſting day; and ſaith moreouer,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Leu. 16.29, 34</note> 
                  <hi>This ſhall be a ſtatute for euer vnto you:</hi> and againe, <hi>This ſhall be an euerlaſting ſtatute vnto you, to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment once a yeere.</hi> Heere we ſee, that God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto the Iewes a ſet faſting day, to bee kept e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery yeere as oft as it ſhould happen. And hence I argue thus; Almighty God himſelf did appoint, and thought it a profitable courſe for his people of the Iewes, to obſerue a ſet and ſtanding day for a Faſt euery yeere. And therefore a ſet time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting may bee obſerued without ſuperſtition and ſinne.</p>
               <p>Some anſwere, that this was a Legall precept
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21717:57"/>of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is now aboliſhed by Chriſt. And I reply; It is true that this precept in reſpect of that particular time, was Legall, and had its end in Chriſts death: but it is no leſſe true alſo, that God in making and appointing that Legall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, did not command them any thing, which in it ſelfe is ſuperſtitious and ſinfull. And therefore, becauſe God preſcribed them a ſet time for that Faſt, it followeth, that the appointing of a ſet time of faſting, is not in it ſelfe ſuperſtitious and ſinfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond place that may ſerue for proofe of this point, is out of the Propheſie of <hi>Zacharie;</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Zach. 8.19.</note> where we finde mention of foure ſeuerall faſting dayes, obſerued euery yeere by the Iewes in their knowne and appointed moneths. Concerning which Faſt thus much is firſt of al to be noted, that they were
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Hieron. in Zach. 8.18, 19. pag. 486. Buxd. Synag. Iudaic. c. 25. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brar. Calend. Hebr. Sept. 3. Dec. 10. Iun. 17, &amp; Iulij 9.</note> occaſioned by the calamities that befel the Iewes about the time, when they were carried captiues into <hi>Babylon,</hi> or before that time; and were appointed, as ſome thinke, by ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet from heauen; or as others, by the authority or conſent of the preſent Church; and (as the Learned generally doe confeſſe) were allowed of and approued by almighty God himſelfe. And hence I reaſon thus; The Iewes did lawfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue foure ſeuerall ſet daies euery yeere, for daies of faſting. And therefore it is not alwayes ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and ſinfull to obſerue ſet faſting dayes.</p>
               <p>Some againe anſwere, that theſe Faſts were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed vpon occaſion of their preſent calamities in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ceaſed at their deliuerance. My re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <pb n="103" facs="tcp:21717:57"/>is, that I ſee no proofe, that theſe Faſts did ceaſe to be obſerued after the Iewes were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of captiuity.

                  <hi>Buxdorfius,</hi> a man well acquainted with the manners and cuſtomes of the Iewes, telleth vs, that the Iewes <hi>to this day do keepe thoſe faſting dayes,</hi> which are there mentioned by the Prophet. But ſay, that they ceaſed vpon the peoples deliuerance, yet it is not true, that they were appointed vpon occaſion of their preſent miſeries in <hi>Babylon;</hi> for other dayes might haue beene as fit for that purpoſe, and perhaps more conuenient then theſe: but as the learned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, by occaſion of ſome miſerable accidents, which befalling them but once, did moue them to faſt the ſame daies that thoſe accidents happened, for many yeeres after. And if thoſe Faſts did laſt no longer then the time of their captiuity, becauſe all that while they had iuſt cauſe to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in remembrance of theſe euils: yet thus much will follow from thence, that therefore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion of a ſorrowfull accident which hath once befalne vs, we may for euer after faſt that ſet day, ſo long as we haue cauſe to be humbled in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of it. And hence againe it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that therefore <hi>Good-Friday</hi> may euery yeere conſtantly be kept for a faſting day, becauſe it was occaſioned by the death of Chriſt for our ſinnes, and we ſhall neuer want iuſt cauſe to bee humbled <pb n="104" facs="tcp:21717:58"/>in remembrance hereof, ſo long as the world laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; becauſe, beſides our old ſinnes, we doe euery yeere commit many moe new ones, which helped to nayle our Sauiour to the Croſſe. The like might be ſaid of ſome other the like dayes. And therefore, there is warrant in Scriptures for ſet and ſtanding times of faſting.</p>
               <p n="2">II. My ſecond proofe is from approued exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Gods Church, both in the time of the Law, and in the time of the Goſpell. For in the time of the Law, the Iewiſh Church kept their ſet dayes of abſtinence, as beſides the Faſts now mentioned out of the Prophet, may further appeare by the words of the Goſpell. For there it is ſaid, that
<hi>the Diſciples of Iohn and of the Phariſes did faſt often,</hi> and more particularly of the Phariſes, that they faſted <hi>twiſe a weeke.</hi> Now as
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Caluin. in Dan. 6.10.</note>
                  <hi>Caluin</hi> concludeth, that <hi>Daniel</hi> had his ſet &amp; prefixed houres of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe it is ſaid that <hi>hee prayed three times a day:</hi> So may I hence inferre, that the Phariſes kept ſet dayes of faſting, becauſe it is ſaid of them, that they <hi>faſted twiſe euery weeke.</hi> And
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. part. 4. de Tempore Ieiun. nu.
54. pa. 95.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Kemnitius</hi> gathereth from the ninth of Saint
<hi>Mathew,</hi> that both the Phariſes and the Diſciples of <hi>Iohn</hi> had <hi>[certa &amp; ſtata tempora ieiuniorum] ſet and ſtanding times for their Faſts.</hi> Now that this practice of theirs is an approued example for vs, appeareth, firſt becauſe our Lord, when he reproueth their errours in their Faſt, yet findeth no fault with this. And ſecondly, becauſe he excuſed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples for not faſting as the Phariſes and
<hi>Iohns</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples did, from the vnſeaſonablenes of the time,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21717:58"/>and promiſed, that after-ward, when the time was fitting, they ſhould then faſt. And this ſheweth, that our Lord was ſo farre from condemning the Phariſes and <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples, that he excuſeth his Diſciples for not doing the like. Againe in the time of the Goſpell, the Chriſtian Church hath ſtill had her ſtanding and ſet dayes for faſting, as the time of <hi>Lent</hi> euery yeere, and the
<hi>Friday</hi> eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weeke, and ſome others; as is ſo apparent, that it cannot be denyed, nor needs not to be proued. And theſe ſet times haue beene commended by many holy and learned Fathers of the Church, but were neuer diſliked by any of them, that euer I could finde. And ſo in concluſion, in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods Church, both before and ſince Chriſts appearing in the fleſh (which heerein was neuer blamed by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, or the learned Fathers) it is no ſinne to keepe ſet dayes of faſting.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third proofe is taken from reaſon grounded on the authority of Scriptures. And my reaſons in that kinde ſhall be theſe two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Nothing is ſinfull, but that which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by Gods Law: for

                  <hi>Sinne is the tranſgreſsion of the Law,</hi> as the Apoſtle defineth it. But to keep ſet dayes of faſting, is no where forbidden by any Lawe of God. It followeth; And therefore to keepe ſuch dayes is no ſinne.</p>
               <p>Againſt this Argument nothing can be excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vnleſſe ſome Text of Gods Law can be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which condemneth or forbiddeth the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of ſuch ſtanding times.

               <p>Now out of theſe obſeruations of theirs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning prayer, I inferre three concluſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning faſting. 1. If it be lawfull and religious to preſcribe ſet houres for prayer; then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſinfull and ſuperſtitious to obſerue ſet daies for faſting. For the fault in theſe ſet dayes, if there bee any, is not becauſe they are dayes or houres, but becauſe they are ſet and ſtanding times. And that exception is as iuſt againſt houres as dayes. Nor is the exception againſt faſting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but againſt feaſting too, and all other ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, if they be tied to fixed times. If ſet houres then be allowed for praying, ſet dayes cannot be condemned in faſting. 2. If ſet times for prayer bee ſo helpefull for the due performing of that worke; then ſet times of humiliation cannot bee ſo hurtfull, as to marre and corrupt that good worke. 3. If to be left at liberty for the times of our praying, bee ſo dangerous to breed an vtter neglect of it: then to leaue times of faſting to each mans preſent choyce, will not be ſo ſafe, nor without feare of neglecting this neceſſary duety. For there is much more feare of neglect in faſting, than in praying; becauſe it is more painefull to the fleſh, and therefore men will be more ready to ſhift it off vpon euery ſleight and idle occaſion. Which would God it were but a ſurmiſe of mine, and that experience had not proued it to be moſt true. For wee all confeſſe that there is great vſe of faſting, when eyther ſinnes doe abound, or iudgements are to be feared; or bleſſings are to be ſought for: and none of vs can thinke or will ſay, <pb n="110" facs="tcp:21717:61"/>but that in all theſe reſpects, there hath beene of late yeeres, and is at this day too great occaſion offered for ſuch humiliation. And yet now that euery man is left to himſelfe to faſt when he will; who almoſt is there, euen among them that are counted religious, who finde themſelues willing to vſe any faſting at all? And hence I inferre, that arbitrary times of faſting are as like to breed a neglect of this duetie, as arbitrary times of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make that duetie forgotten. Fourthly, If <hi>Daniels</hi> ſet houres were free from <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee vſed them [<hi>abſque vlla opinione ſanctita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>] <hi>without any opinion of holineſſe</hi> in that time: then the Church of England cannot bee charged with
<hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> for her ſet dayes of faſting; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee vſeth theſe without placing ſanctitie in thoſe times. And now out of all theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations I may boldly conclude the poynt, that ſet times of faſting are not onely lawfull, but very expedient for the conſtant and religious practice of humiliation. And indeed experience ſheweth, that exerciſes which ſtand in a continued practice and often reiterating of them, are then performed with moſt diligence, and greateſt fruit, when they haue their fixed and ſet times allotted vnto them. My ſelfe, when I liued in the Vniuerſity among Scholers, did obſerue that it was held for a note of a good Student, that allowing himſelf fit time for ſleepe and recreation, and ſuch like neceſſary workes, the reſt of his houres remaining, hee did deſtinate and aſſigne for ſeuerall exerciſes and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies us ſuch houres for Logick or Philoſophy, <pb n="111" facs="tcp:21717:61"/>and ſuch for Oratory or Poetry; and ſuch for Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory or Geography, &amp;c. By which fixed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and conſtant obſeruing of their appoynted times, ſuch Students gayned great furtherance for their Studies, which others wanted. For firſt, they tooke order that no ſeaſonable time ſhould be miſ-ſpent without making profit: but taking a view of their whole time, they allotted euery houre to ſome vſe. Secondly, when their houre was come for ſuch or ſuch a buſineſſe, the very ſtriking of the Clock did admoniſh them to break off company, and preſently to betake themſelues to their taske: whereas others, who had no ſuch ſet houres, would goe beyond the time, and in chatting and idleneſſe trifle away many a good houre without taking account of it. Thirdly, when they were come to their ſtudies, they knew what they had to doe, and without further delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration went on with their worke: whereas ſome others, when they came to their ſtudies, were ſcarce reſolued what booke fitted their turne; and ſo for want of orderly proceeding, they loſt the fruit of that little time and ſmall paynes which they tooke. And fourthly, if at any time, eyther occaſion of friends, or occurrence of ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe did intercept their time, and beguile them of their houres, they were ſenſible of that loſſe, and did watch all opportunities to re-gaine it. And by this ſet courſe of ſtudy, ſuch Students in ſhort time gayned much knowledge, and farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their fellowes. And as this hath been found in experience to be the readieſt way for a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <pb n="112" facs="tcp:21717:62"/>to profit in his learning: ſo for my part, I know no better way of thriuing and profiting in Chriſts Schoole, then if wee obſerue the ſame rule, and ſet our ſelues conuenient times for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of religious dueties: as ſuch a time to pray with our houſhold, and ſuch a time to reade Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and other bookes of Religion, and ſuch a time to examine our conſciences and ſee what we haue done, and ſuch a time to faſt and vſe humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for our ſinnes. For it may be feated, if wee appoynt our ſelues no ſet times for good due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wee will ſpend but a little time about them.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of all which maketh mee to thinke, that the obſeruation of ſet times for our Faſting-dayes, is ſo farre from corrupting our Faſts with <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> as that it doth much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vs to a conſtant and religious practice of them.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Lord continued his Faſt for <hi>forty dayes and forty nights:</hi> but that was miraculous and aboue the power of nature in him, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is not to be imitated by vs in the ſame manner. Yet iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <pb n="113" facs="tcp:21717:62"/>is offered to enquire how long our Faſts ought to bee continued. For diſtinct anſwere whereto, wee muſt note a difference betweene Faſts of ordinary or vſuall continuance, and of extraordinary and vnuſuall.</p>
               <p>And to begin firſt with the later; vnuſuall and extraordinary I call that, which is for longer time and ſpace, than is commonly vſed, or is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily expedient. In this kinde <hi>Paul
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Act. 9.9.</note> faſted three dayes</hi> in Damaſcus; and <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the Iewes <hi>faſted</hi> for <hi>Eſter
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Eſter 4.16, 17.</note> three daies and three nights.</hi> And for the continuance of ſuch Faſts, I cannot preciſely ſay, for how many dayes and houres they are to be obſerued; onely theſe two things I can ſay in the generall. 1. That they muſt bee no longer than the ſtrength and power of mans nature may beare; as I haue ſhewed already. 2. That the ſpace of their continuance is to bee meaſured by the occaſion that requireth them, and by the deuotion and diſcretion of them that keepe them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, the vſuall continuance of a Faſt I call it, when the abſtinence is obſerued ſo long as is vſuall among Gods ſeruants in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe of life, and is commonly practized by them in their religious Faſts. And for determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſpace of ſuch a Faſt, ſome ſay that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Faſt muſt bee continued for foure and twenty houres: and the reaſon is, becauſe on the day of
<hi>Expiation,</hi> God doth enioyne abſtinence <hi>from euening to euening.</hi> But of this place I haue told my opinion before, and now againe I ſay <pb n="114" facs="tcp:21717:63"/>vnder correction, firſt, that this place requireth that ſpace of time for the celebrating of a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath or Feſtiuall day; but ſaith not the like of a Faſting-day. Secondly, If the Faſt there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, be meant to continue for foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie houres, as I will not deny but it may be ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; yet that is required in this Faſt, as it was a ſeruice belonging to an holy day, not as it was an abſtinence required on a Faſting-day. And therefore it was enioyned in this Faſt, but is not ſo in all Faſts. Hee ſpeaketh more reſonably as I take it, that ſaith,

                  <hi>A true Faſt is an abſtinence or forbearing eyther of dinner vntill euening, or of ſupper vntill dinner time the next day; or elſe, of both of them together.</hi> But yet for more diſtinct conceiuing of the poynt, I will ſet downe mine opinion, with ſubmiſſion to better iudgements, in three ſeuerall propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The preciſe time and diſtinct houres how long a Faſt muſt be continued, is not any where that I know of, peremptorily defined or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, eyther in the holy Scriptures, or in any Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Ancients. For as for the Scriptures, wee finde examples of ſome that haue faſted <hi>for three dayes,</hi> and many that haue faſted <hi>till night:</hi> but where eyther that ſpace or any other is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, for my part, I confeſſe, I know not. And for the ancient Church it is a cleare caſe, that they vſed to faſt, ſomtime till euening, and many times but till three a clocke in the afternoone. Which ſheweth, that they thought no ſet ſpace of time abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:21717:63"/>
               <p n="2">2. In euery religious Faſt, the abſtinence muſt be continued ſo long, as that the body by wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ordinary food, may bee in ſome ſort cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened and afflicted. For ſo the Scriptures ſet out a Faſt vnto vs, as accompanied with chaſtening and humiliation. Thus
<hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Pſal. 69.10.</note> 
                  <hi>I wept and chaſtened my ſoule with faſting.</hi> And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell ſpeaking of
<hi>Daniels</hi> Faſt,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Dan. 10.12.</note> 
                  <hi>When thou didſt ſet thine heart</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>to vnderſtand, and to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten thy ſelfe before thy God.</hi> And <hi>Ezrah,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ezrah. 8.21.</note> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed a Faſt, that wee might afflict our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</hi> By all which and other moe ſayings to like purpoſe, it is apparant, that in euery true Faſt there is an afflicting of the body. Which how it is to be vnderſtood, I haue declared
<note n="(d)" place="margin">Cap. 4. pa. 49, &amp;c.</note> elſewhere.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The longer our abſtinence is, (ſo it bee with moderation and regard to a mans ſtrength; ſuch as heretofore I deſcribed) the more perfect the Faſt is, and the more auaileable for the good which we intend by it. My reaſons are. Firſt, becauſe faſting is ordained for humiliation and <hi>chaſtening</hi> of our ſelues before God, which the more ſenſible it is, the more effectuall it proueth: but the longer the abſtinence is, the greater is the humiliation or <hi>chaſtening</hi> that is wrought by it. And therefore, the longer the abſtinence, the perfiter the Faſt is. Secondly, Vpon extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occaſions, and when greater need required; then Gods ſeruants haue been accuſtomed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the time of their faſting, as I haue ſhewed before in <hi>Eſter,</hi> and the men of labeſh, &amp;c. And this ſheweth, that the longer the abſtinence is, the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21717:64"/>more powerfull the Faſt is. Thirdly, The anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church did vſe longer abſtinence in Lent time, than on other Faſting-dayes; intending therein, as in all the other religious duties, to ſhew more piety than at other times they vſed. And this ſheweth that the longer the abſtinence is, the more perfit they thought the Faſt to be. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this concluſion is acknowledged by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries of the Romiſh Church. For though they defend the looſeneſſe of their Church, which permitteth them on Faſting-dayes to take their dinner at the vſuall time; yet they confeſſe,
<note n="a" place="margin">

B.</note> that by how much later the houre of our eating is, by ſo much our Faſt is the better, and that they know well enough, that the Faſt is ſo much the more perfit, by how much the refection after it, is the longer protracted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The vſuall time of abſtinence mentioned in Scriptures, in an vſuall and ordinary Faſt, is the ſpace of one day from morning till night. Thus it is ſaid of the children of Iſrael,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Iudg. 20.26.</note> that <hi>they wept, and ſate before the Lord, and faſted that day vntill euen:</hi> and of <hi>Dauid</hi> and his men,
<note n="(c)" place="margin">2. Sam. 1.12.</note> that <hi>they faſted vntill euen for Saul, and for Ionathan, &amp;c.</hi> and of
<hi>Dauid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> when hee mourned for <hi>Abuer,</hi> that hee would not be perſwaded by the people to eate meat, while it was yet day, but ſware, ſaying,
<note n="(d)" place="margin">2. Sam. 3.35.</note> 
                  <hi>So doe God to mee, and more alſo, if I taſte bread or ought elſe, till the Sunne bee downe.</hi> And ſo elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And according to this cuſtome it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued of the Iewes, that euer ſince, they haue kept their Faſt,
<note n="(e)" place="margin">Buxdorf. Synag. Iudaic. cap. 25. pag.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21717:64"/>And leſſe time of abſtinence then this, I no where finde vſed in Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the Primitiue Church I finde, that in the beginning they faſted till ſixe of the clocke in the afternoone, or till ſun ſetting, which in common eſtimation is about ſixe of the clocke. For that is the moſt indifferent time, to meaſure the euening by, &amp; the moſt proportionable to the whole yeer, and moſt anſwerable to the cuſtome of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the old Teſtament. For there was not ſuch difference betweene the day and the night among the Iewes, as is among vs. For in
<hi>Iurie,</hi> the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt day had tenne houres, and the longeſt night but foureteene. Whence it followeth, that for the greateſt part of the yeere, the ſun did ſet much what about ſixe, either not long after, or not long before it. And when the greateſt inequality was, as in the depth of winter, it did ſet at fiue of the clocke, and in the height of ſummer at ſeuen. And therefore the moſt equall time to meaſure the end of the day or the ſunne ſetting by for all the yeer, is ſixe of the clocke. And that I take to haue bin the vſuall time, when both the Iewes and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians did breake off their Faſts. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Chriſtians began to abridge the time of the abſtinence, and to ceaſe their Faſts, at leaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, about three of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone. Which
<hi>Azorius</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">

For they, ſauing Sundayes and feſtiuall times, were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to faſt euery day; and it might ſeeme perhaps too much ſtrictnes, in ſuch continuall ſort, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſo long abſtinence: and therefore though in Lent time, and vpon other dayes of more ſtraite diſcipline, they vſed to faſt till night, yet ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily they broke off their Faſts three houres ſooner. But if it were decay of zeale in thoſe former Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that they ceaſed their Faſts before night, then it muſt needs be an extinction of zeale in the Romane Church, who breaketh her Faſt at the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall time of eating: or rather doth not keepe any Faſt ſo long.</p>
               <p>And now out of all this, we haue in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall this cleare and manifeſt concluſion, That though no preciſe time for continuance is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in Gods Word; yet the continuance of a Faſt, without eating or drinking till euening, (which by common eſtimation is held to be about ſixe of the clocke) is approued of in Scriptures, and was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the ancient Chriſtians, and commended of all: and that the ſhortening of this time, was from decay of deuotion. And therefore if wee would take a ſafe way, and that which is beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of all, we muſt continue our abſtinence on our faſting dayes, till night; without eating or drinking till about euening, vnleſſe infirmity or ſome other neceſſary cauſe doe require refreſhing ſooner. But more particularly, we may from the former diſcourſe gather and obſerue theſe things following.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:21717:65"/>
               <p n="1">1. Wee may ſee, that the Faſt of Proteſtants, which is continued in perfect abſtinence from all meate and drinke till the euening, is more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the cuſtome of Gods people in former ages, and is in it ſelfe, a better and more perfect Faſt, then the Faſt of Papiſts is, euen our Enemies being Iudges. For they praiſe it for a better Faſt, which hath the longer abſtinence: and we faſt till night, whereas they doe not ſo much as forbeare eating till mid-day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may ſee, with how little God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented at our hands, in reſpect of that which Chriſt performed for our ſakes. For abſtinence for the ſpace of one day is accepted of God, for a good dutie of humiliation; but Chriſt our Lord faſted <hi>forty dayes and forty nights</hi> for the furthering of our ſaluation. And yet whereas Chriſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all this for our ſakes, we think it too much to doe this little for his ſake. Nay, as the Iewes were wearie of the Sabbath day, and times of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and ſaid,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Amos 8.5.</note> 
                  <hi>When will the new-moone be gone, and the Sabbath, that we may ſet foorth wheat?</hi> And againe,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Mal. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold what a wearineſſe is it?</hi> ſay they. And <hi>ye haue ſnuffed at it, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> So we may finde men, that when they come to heare a Sermon, are weary of hearing, and wiſh that the Sermon were ended before the time: and when they come to Church-Seruice, are weary of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wiſh that the Seruice were ended before the time: but eſpecially if they vndertake an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Faſt, are ſooner wearie of the Abſtinence, and wiſh that the faſting day were ended before the <pb n="120" facs="tcp:21717:66"/>time. But a good Chriſtian for diſcouering of his owne corruption, ſhould take notice of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality between Chriſts ſufferings for our ſakes, and our ſuffering for his ſake. And if the fleſh grow weary of hearing or reading or praying or faſting for a conuenient &amp; requiſite time; he ſhould check himſelfe with the example of his Sauiour, and ſay to himſelfe: But
<hi>my Lord and Maſter preached all day,</hi> and <hi>prayed all night,</hi> and <hi>faſted many dayes and nights</hi> together for my ſake; and ſhall I grudge to ſpend one houre, or one day in his ſeruice, &amp; for his Names ſake? The religious ſoule that ſhall thus now and then checke his owne dulneſſe, will by the meditation heereof gaine more feruour in Gods ſeruice.</p>

               <p>That which I conceiue moſt probable, I will ſet downe in three diſtinct and ſeuerall aſſertions: <pb n="123" facs="tcp:21717:67"/>but with ſubmiſſion to better indgement.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Pro.</hi> It is certaine that the obſeruation of Lent was very ancient and receiued throughout the whole Chriſtian Church. For whoſoeuer ſhal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe the writings of the Fathers, ſhall finde menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, in men of all countries, and euen as neere to the Apoſtles times, as any Monuments or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Church doe reach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> It is not certaine that it was either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted or obſerued by the Apoſtles of Chriſt, as any Rule or Order agreed vpon by them for the vſe of the Church. My reaſons are.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) Becauſe no man, who liued in their time, or within that age, doth ſay it, nor can any other tell, which of them, or in what manner, or with what inſtructions they either ordained or obſerued it. And to ſay, that therefore it is of the Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, becauſe no other Author is knowne, is a coniecture that may faile vs.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.)
<note n="(a)" place="margin">V. Fileſac. de Quadrag. c. 2. &amp; ſeqq. v. etia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Vedel. Exerc. 10. in Ignat. ep. ad Philip. cap. 3. nu. 11. &amp; ſeqq.</note> Becauſe the Faſt of Lent was anciently obſerued in diuers Churches and Countries after a very diuerſe and different maner. For firſt, there was a difference in the number of weekes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this vſe: ſome obſeruing eight weekes, ſome ſeuen, ſome ſixe, and ſome, as we now doe, ſixe weekes and foure dayes. Secondly, there was difference in the faſting daies of Lent; for in ſome places, they faſted euery day, ſaue Sunday; in ſome other, euery day, except Saturday and Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; in ſome other, euery ſecond day; and in ſome, but euery other weeke onely. For on thoſe other dayes in Lent, though they abſtained from
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21717:68"/>ſome meats, yet they did eate their dinner; and then the Ancients thought it to be no faſting day. Now if there had been any ſet order agreed vpon by the Apoſtles for the practice of the Church, in all likely hood, there could not haue beene ſuch variety in ſo ſhort a time. It may be, I deny not, that the Apoſtles, who were frequent in faſtings, (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of himſelfe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27.) did vſe it at this time more frequently and for longer time, then at other times of the yeere; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were now occaſioned to remember the ſufferings of their Maſter, and anon after to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate his Reſurection. And this practice might perhaps giue occaſion to the Churches abroad, to take example by them, and to celebrate a more ſolemne and longer Faſt at that ſeaſon; but with ſuch different obſeruations and facions, as vſually falleth out among ſundry nations and companies; when all agree in one end or maine worke, but haue not the ſame Rules to proceed by, preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto them. But if this be ſuppoſed, yet ſtill I ſay, that it is not certaine, that the Apoſtles did eyther inſtitute or obſerue a Lent Faſt of forty daies, ſuch as is now vſed in the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> There is no reaſon to imagine, that the Faſt of <hi>Lent</hi> was any precept of Chriſts, either deliuered by his own mouth, or giuen to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by inſpiration or otherwiſe. And for this my reaſons are two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. My firſt reaſon ſhall be the ſame with that which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vſed in the very like caſe. Hee diſputing of the <hi>Saturdayes</hi> Faſt, againſt one
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21717:68"/>who vrged the neceſſitie of it, concludeth or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth in this manner:
<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ego in Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicis &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicis literis, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tóque inſlrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, quod appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Teſtamentum nouum, animo id reuoluens, video praeceptum eſſe ieiunium. Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus autem die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus non operteat ieiunare, &amp; quibus oporteat, praecepto Domini vel Apoſtolorum non inuenio defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum. As per hoc ſenlio, &amp;c.</hi> Auguſtin. Ep. 86. ad Caſulan. pag. 132. C.</note> 
                  <hi>I</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>hauing in my minde reuolued the New Teſtament, doe finde that Faſting is commanded in the Writings of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts and Apoſtles; but on what dayes men ought not to faſt, and on what they ought, I no where finde it determined, by any commandement of Chriſt, or of his Apoſtles. [Atque per hoc ſentio, &amp;c.] And for this cauſe I thinke</hi> that there is no ſuch neceſſity in the Saturdaies faſt; otherwiſe than as the orders and cuſtome of euery Church doe require. In which diſpute of that learned Father, I conſider two things for my purpoſe. 1. I note his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>It is not found to bee appoynted or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Writings of the New Teſtament.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I note his concluſion, which hee infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth hereupon; <hi>[Atque per hoc ſentio, &amp;c.] And therefore I thinke</hi> it no precept of Chriſt. And ſo I may reaſon in this caſe; Let a man reade all the Writings of the Apoſtles and Euangeliſts, and he ſhall no where finde, that the Faſt of Lent was appoynted by the commandement eyther of GOD, or of Chriſt, or of his Apoſtles. <hi>[Atque per hoc ſentio,]</hi> And therefore I am of opinion that it is no commandement of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My ſecond reaſon is, becauſe there is no proofe that may perſwade vs, that this inſtitution was Chriſts precept. For all the reaſon that is brought for this purpoſe, ſo farre as I can learne or obſerue, is onely this, becauſe ſome of the Ancients ſay, that it was appoynted by Chriſt, or by Almighty God. But they who ſpeake thus,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21717:69"/>doe not meane that which theſe men would haue who alledge them. For

285.</note> Writers of the Roman Church ſay the like of other Fathers, and conclude, that their ſayings doe not proue this to be any Diuine precept: but that when they ſay that <hi>Lent</hi>-Faſt was of Gods appoynting, wee muſt vnderſtand their words thus, that they meant to ſay, that it had ſome ground in Scriptures, in that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> and Chriſt did faſt forty dayes, or to like purpoſe. And if this be all, then the Fathers doe not ſay that Lent was of Chriſts inſtitution, or was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted by any command of his. And, other proofe than this, there is none that I know of, ſo much as tendered vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The concluſion then of all is, that this Faſt of Lent is of very ancient obſeruation, but not of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine or Apoſtolicall inſtitution: for ought that yet hath beene proued.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond particular to be inquired into, is, How and in what ſort Lent was kept in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church. And for anſwere hereto, my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not, neyther is it neceſſary, to enquire into all the ſeuerall cuſtomes and orders that were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among them, which were an endleſſe and needleſſe piece of worke: but onely to note the extraordinary zeale and deuotion, which they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <pb n="127" facs="tcp:21717:69"/>at this time more than at other. And that may be ſeene in foure things eſpecially.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the length and continuance of their Faſts. For whereas at other times in the yeere they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted one or two or three dayes in one weeke, and ſeldome oftner or more; in the time of Lent, for the moſt part, they vſed to faſt eyther ſixe or fiue dayes together, and that for diuers weekes one after another, without intermiſſion.

               <p n="2">2. In the hardneſſe or meaneneſſe of their fare, when they did eate. For on thoſe dayes,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">v. Antiqu. Liturg. to. 2. in feriam 6. poſt Cineres. p. 106.</note> when they did not faſt, as on Sundayes and Saturdayes, they did take both their dinner and ſupper; and on their faſting-dayes, after abſtinence all day, they refreſhed themſelues at night: but ſtill their dyet was both ſparing and courſe; ſuch as
<hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> vſed in his Faſt of three weekes. For as he ſaith of that time,

                  <hi>I ate no pleaſant bread, neyther came fleſh nor wine in my mouth, &amp;c.</hi> So theſe ancient Chriſtians during the time of Lent, did forbeare fleſh and wine and ſtrong drinkes, and all nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pleaſant food.

And as for other Chriſtians, whoſe life was not ſpotted with any noted and open ſinne, yet they alſo exerciſed themſelues in the practice of ſtrict diſcipline, as in examining their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and amercing themſelues for their ſinnes, and refraining their vſuall delights and recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and all with more ſtrictneſſe and ſeueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than at other times they were accuſtomed to vſe.</p>

               <p>This was their manner of ſpending their Lent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. The proofe of which particulars, out of the ancient Writers, I haue forborne to ſet downe at large, becauſe I thought it would but trouble the ordinary Reader: and if any liſt to ſee the ſeuerall teſtimonies for confirmation heereof, I haue in the margin poynted him to ſuch Authors, as haue gathered them to his hand, and where the learned Reader may finde them, if he pleaſe. In the mean while, we may take notice of the holy vſe that the Ancients made of this time of humiliation: which practice of theirs, if it had bin continued among them, who boaſt themſelues of <hi>Abraham</hi> to bee their Father, and make claime to bee the children of the Catholike Church, they had not brought ſuch a ſcandall vpon this holy diſcipline, as in theſe latter dayes they haue.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third thing to be enquired concerning Lent-Faſt is, What good vſes it had among thoſe Ancients, and might haue among vs, if wee did follow their example. And heereto mine anſwer is, that the generall vſe of this inſtitution was, that the people of God might haue a ſolemne and ſpeciall time of the yeere, wherein they might in a more ſpeciall and more exact and deuouter manner take account of their liues, and reckon with their ſoules for the yeere paſt, and amend whatſoeuer defects they had incurred, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all ſuch ſeruices as might both correct the errors of the yeere paſt, and fit them for all holy duties for the yeere to come. And this practice might bee of great vſe for all thoſe that ſhould
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21717:71"/>vſe it accordingly; and that in diuers reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe there may be ſome publike offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces committed by the body of the Church, either in the omiſſion of ſome common duty, or in their neglect of gouernment and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or in the miſ-ordering of the publike State. And for ſuch ſinnes as theſe, it is very reaſonable, that as the whole body hath ſinned, ſo the whole body ſhould ſorrow and repent, &amp; by their ioynt humiliation &amp; ſubmiſſion ſeeke reconciliation and pardon. For which purpoſe we may reade, that God did not onely appoint the Prieſt and the Prince &amp; the people to bring ſinne-offerings for their errours; but enioyned alſo an Oblation for the <hi>Community</hi> or body of the Church.

That beſides the ſinnes of particular men, there might be ſome ſinnes of the whole <hi>Community:</hi> ſinnes which were properly neither the ſins of the Prieſt, nor of the Prince, nor of the people alone, (for of all theſe hee had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before, and had appointed them their ſeuerall ſacrifices and oblations for their atonement;) but ſinnes they were of the whole Congregation. As for example, ſaith <hi>Toſtatus,</hi> when ſome Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or dutie was neglected by all, and not noted or queſtioned by any. Or 2. when the body repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatiue, they in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the chief gouernment reſted, <pb n="131" facs="tcp:21717:71"/>did commit ſome errour againſt Gods Law, either in making, or in executing, or in neglecting of publike Lawes, or in any other miſcarriage about the publike ſtate. And ſuch ſlips as theſe may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be committed by the Congregation or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the Church at this day. Secondly note, that when ſuch offence was committed, God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that as the whole Congregation was guilty, ſo the whole ſhould ioyne in the ſinne-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. And ſo it is requiſite, that for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſins, which eſcape the body of the Church, the whole body ſhould ioyne together in one, and haue ſome appointed time, in which by their ioynt repentance they may obtaine common for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe. For which purpoſe the time of Lent might ſerue moſt conueniently: it being the time in which the whole Chriſtian Church in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes, did vſe publike humiliation; and in which Kings and Nobles and people did ioyne in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of faſting and ſorrow. Which courſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation if Chriſtian States and people did vſe accordingly, then I doubt not, but many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Common-wealths might haue ſtood firme and in a flouriſhing eſtate, which now are ruinated, or poſſeſſed by the Enemy; becauſe they did not preuent Gods Iuſtice by their open and publike repentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there might be good vſe of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Lent for the former purpoſe, becauſe in the compaſſe of a yeere, there may happen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faults and diſtempers in our ſoules, which are not diſcernable in the ſpace of a day or a weeke <pb n="132" facs="tcp:21717:72"/>or a moneth. Euery man findeth by experience in his houſes and dwellings, that if he view them at the daies or weekes end, hee ſhall many times perceiue but ſmall difference; but after a yeere or more he will ſpy ſome defects, which at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the yeere they had not. And ſo in his clothes, and the veſſell of his houſe, after ſo much ſpace of time, he may ſee decay in the one, and ruſt in the other, though he could not obſerue any ſuch change in the euening from that which they were in the morning, or at the end of the weeke from that which they were at the beginning. And ſo euen religious minds, though they fall not into ſome notorious ſinne, which ſheweth it ſelfe at the firſt view, yet they may decay in the feruour of their zeale,

               <p n="3">3. There may be vſe alſo, becauſe in a matter of ſo great importance as is ſaluation and eternall happines, beſides the ordinary care, for which a Chriſtian hath opportunity &amp; liberty euery day, ſome more ſpeciall time, to bee employed with more exact diligence, may be very conuenient at the leaſt, if not altogether neceſſary. For thus we ſee in trading and houſe-keeping, men thinke it not inough, to booke vp their expences and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts euery day, nor to take account of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe <pb n="133" facs="tcp:21717:72"/>at the weekes end; but beſides that ordinary care, they vſe once in the yeere to caſt vp their ſhops, and compare their bookes, and take a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall view of all that hath paſt before in the yeere: that ſo they may correct their errors, and ſupply their defects, and better their whole courſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for the time to come. And the like care ſchoolemaſters take with their ſchollers: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their daily and weekely exerciſes and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; once in the yeere they do lightly exact of their ſchollers an entire repetition of all their Grammer rules, that by diſuſe they doe not decay in the grounds of their learning. And thus in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſoule,
<note place="margin">Leu. 16.29, 34.</note> God appointed the Iewes one ſpeciall day, or (as ſome thinke) two dayes in the yeere, wherein (ouer and aboue their ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Religion, vſed at other times) they ſhould wholly intend the ſifting of their ſoules, and ſhould in a more exact manner exerciſe the workes of repentance and humiliation, and chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement for their ſinnes. And ſo the Chriſtian Church, beſide all their other inſtructions &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes for that purpoſe, which happen euery day in one kinde or other, hath moreouer appointed a ſet and ſolemne time in the yeere, to celebrate the memory of Chriſts birth, and circumciſion, and of his death, and reſurrection, and aſcenſion into heauen, and ſuch like other myſteries of ſaluation. And ſo in like manner, it will be a very profitable courſe for Chriſtians, if they haue a ſet and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne time of the yeere, for the more exact and perfect examination of their conſciences, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting <pb n="134" facs="tcp:21717:73"/>of their ſoules for ſinne, and the quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their zeale for Gods ſeruice. And for this purpoſe the inſtitution of Lent, as it was vſed by the ancient Church, is moſt proper and moſt profitable.</p>
               <p>Now out of theſe two laſt poynts layed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we may learne not to eſteeme and thinke of the ancient inſtitution and vſe of Lent, according to the new obſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For if we looke vpon it according to the intention &amp; practice of the old Chriſtian Church, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not chooſe but thinke it to be a chiefe time of deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſuch a practice of holy diſcipline, as may ſeaſon mens minds for all the yeere after. But if we looke vpon it according to the doctrine and practice of the Roman Church, we may then iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinke it a ſuperſtitious foppery; as many of the Worthies and learned Writers of the reformed Churches haue ſpoken and written of it. Which ſpeeches of theirs, becauſe they may ſeeme ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to inuolue the ancient Fathers &amp; the nouell Doctors of the Roman Church in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; and haue therefore giuen occaſion to the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to declame againſt our Churches, as if they condemned all the Ancient Fathers of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition in their allowance of this Lent-faſt: it will not be impertinent, if in this place, I adde a few words more for the defence of our Churches Doctrine. Whereas therefore our Aduerſaries ſay, and that with great and loud ourcries, that we and our Churches doe not onely condemne all faſting, and in particular this Faſt of Lent; but <pb n="135" facs="tcp:21717:73"/>that we doe withall accuſe all the old and purer Churches of Chriſt, as being ſuperſtitious in their vſe of theſe Faſts; mine anſwere is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For forreine Churches beyond the Seas, which haue aboliſhed the vſe of Lent-Faſt, I ſay, they may haue as iuſt or reaſonable a defence for their doing, as the Church of Rome hath for her doings about ſome other Faſts. For it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by her owne children, that

And if any priuate men among vs haue condemned all vſe of Lent-Faſt, it is their priuate opinion, not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by our Church. And therefore as themſelues <pb n="136" facs="tcp:21717:74"/>will not anſwer for euery incommodious ſpeech, that hath fallen from the lippes or pennes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Writers; no more ought they to charge our Church with euery ſuch ſaying that any priuate Doctor of her profeſſion hath vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If any Diuines in the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue vttered any thing to the preiudice ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of faſting in generall, or of this Faſt of Lent in particular; they looked vpon it, as they then ſaw it practiſed: and finding it full of ſuperſtition in the Church of Rome, they could not conceiue much better vſe of it, than they found among them, who magnified it ſo much. And therefore wee may thanke the Church of Rome for the contempt or diſlike that Lent hath of late growne into.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The ſpeeches which theſe learned men haue let fall againſt theſe Faſts, were vttered amidſt their contentions and controuerſies with the Roman Church, and while they were iuſtly offended with her ſuperſtitions. And in ſuch a caſe, it is not ſtrange, if men bending themſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſent errours, doe ſometimes at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares runne too farre the contrary way.

And on the contrary fide, Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> defending free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will againſt the Manichees, did extoll it too farre with ſome wrong to Gods grace. And ſo it is no vnpardonable errour, if ſome learned men among vs, or in our Churches, haue in hatred to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of Rome, ſpoken too harſhly of the deuotions of elder times. And this ſhall ſuffice for anſwere to this accuſation or calumnie rather of the Romiſh Doctors.</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. The fourth queſtion concerning this time of Lent, is, Why this time of the yeere was made choyce of for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I finde many reaſons giuen by diuers
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:21717:75"/>men. But of thoſe many, the greater part may ſeeme to haue beene inuented after the inſtitution of Lent, to ſhew the congruity and fitneſſe of it. The true reaſons, which I thinke did moue the Church at the beginning to ordaine this time of humiliation, were onely but two of them.</p>
               <p>Of the former ſort were theſe and ſuch like.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is a politique reaſon: and it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this time of the yeere is a time of <hi>breed,</hi> and of the increaſe of creatures; and the ſparing of the increaſe by abſtinence and ſlender diet, might cauſe plenty and ſtore in the Common-wealth for all the yeere after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond is a phyſicall reaſon, which is, becauſe
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Filliuc. Tractat. 27. cap. 5. part. 2. q. 8. num. 97. pag. 287.</note> at this time of the yeere there is moſt increaſe of bloud in a mans body, and the heate thereof might breed Feuers and hot diſeaſes; but ſpare diet, eſpecially conſiſting of fiſh, and hearbes and rootes, &amp;c. will ſerue to qualifie the bloud, and to bring it to a right temper.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is a reaſon of alluſion to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the yeere. For
<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſimam largitue eſt nobis Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mnus, vt buius tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris ſpatio in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem totius cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aturae nunc con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiamus virtutu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> germina.—Terra, indictâ Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſimâ, aſperitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deponit hiemis; ego indictâ Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drageſimâ, aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem reijcio delictorum.

C.F.</note> now fields and gardens, trees and hearbes, and all vegetables doe ſprowt and flouriſh and grow: and ſo with the ſeaſon of the yeere, Chriſtians ſhould haue their ſpring of grace, and be now more plentifull in all good due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and offices of Religion. Againe, now is the ſeed-time of the world: Men plow and harrow and breake the clods of the ground, that it may be fit to receiue ſeed, and to bring forth a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull increaſe: and ſo men being admoniſhed by the courſe of nature, ſhould now take occaſion to <pb n="139" facs="tcp:21717:75"/>ranſack their conſciences, and humble their ſoules, and chaſten the whole man, that they may be the more fit to receiue the ſeedes of grace, and to bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth is a reaſon drawne from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of mortification at this time. For now bloud doth moſt increaſe, and is moſt hot and ſtirring,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ianſen. in Concord. cap. 15. pag.
124. col 2. E. Filli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uc. Tractat. 27. cap. 5. part. 2. q. 8. num, 97. Aliique.</note> and the heat of nature is apt to produce increaſe of luſt. And therefore as men in the ſpring-time doe abſtaine from Wine and ſtrong drinkes, leſt they ſhould breed Feuers and hot diſtempers in the body: ſo it is requiſite that they ſhould forbeare nouriſhing meates, and vſe abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, leſt full feeding ſhould breed youthfull luſts and diſtempers in the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch like are the reaſons of congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie, which (vnder correction) I thinke men did afterward inuent, to ſhew the reaſonableneſſe and fitneſſe of this conſtitution: but now the proper reaſons, which did (as I take it) induce the Church to appoynt this Faſt, were theſe two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the time going before Eaſter, was the time of Chriſts ſufferings and paſſion and death. In thoſe dayes it was, that he was betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Diſciple, and ſweat bloud in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and was accuſed and condemned and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and buried for our ſinnes: which ſufferings of Chriſt are ſtill to be remembred with thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe by euery Chriſtian. And becauſe the moſt expreſſe remembrance of things paſt, is at the ſame time when they were done: therefore this time of the yeere, in which Chriſt did vndergoe <pb n="140" facs="tcp:21717:76"/>his ſufferings, was thought the fitteſt ſeaſon in which Chriſtians ſhould celebrate the memory of them.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> was now at hand, and that was the day in which our Lord roſe againe from his graue; in which new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts were baptized in great number, and in which
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21717:77"/>all ſorts of men did come in flockes to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the Lords Supper. And therefore as the Euangeliſt ſaith of the Iewes Eaſter,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ioh. 19.31.</note> that <hi>that was an high day:</hi> ſo it may much more be ſaid of the Chriſtians Eaſter, that it is an <hi>high day,</hi> and to bee kept with all celebrity, and in the moſt deuouteſt manner. And in reſpect heereof, the Ancients were wont to keepe this Feaſt, not for one day onely, or for three dayes ſpace, as wee now doe, but for a whole weeke together. Yea, and ſome feſtiuity and remembrance of it, they kept for ſixe weekes more, euen till Whitſontide, or the day of Pentecoſt. Now that the great celebrity of this <hi>high day</hi> might be performed with better deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and more religious reioycing, the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thought it neceſſarie, that men ſhould bee prepared aforehand for the performance of ſo weighty a ſeruice. And therefore as the Iews
<note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Chron. 35.6. &amp; Ioh. 11.55</note> had their dayes of preparation before the Paſſeouer; and as Chriſtians haue their faſting eues to goe before their feſtiuall dayes, that by their former dayes repentance they may be prepared for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reioycing the next day after: ſo the Chriſtian Church did thinke it neceſſary, before this great Feaſt of Chriſts Reſurrection, to appoint ſome large and ſolemne time for humiliation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, that men being prepared by a ſerious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of al good duties, they might be the more fit to pray for the new Conuerts, and to receiue the bleſſed Sacrament, and to praiſe God for his Sons Reſurrection, and to paſſe this holy day with an holy and heauenly reioycing. And theſe, I take <pb n="143" facs="tcp:21717:77"/>it, were the true reaſons.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The fift and laſt queſtion concerning Lent, is, What relation this Faſt of <hi>fortie dayes</hi> in the Church, hath to that of our Sauiour, when he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted <hi>forty dayes</hi> in the Wilderneſſe.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. The ſecond anſwere is, that though Chriſt did not in words giue any ſuch Law, or appoint any ſuch order, yet his bare example doth tye Chriſtians to the like obſeruation &amp; practice. Of this opinion ſome later Diuines in the Roman Church may ſeeme to bee, who (as

For all the reaſon that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is (ſo farre as I know) only the authorities of ſome Fathers; which haue not that meaning, as Doctors of their owne Chruch haue endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to declare.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. The third anſwere is, that neither Chriſts precept nor practice doth force or require Chriſtians to keepe a Faſt of fortie dayes, or this which we call our Lent-Faſt: but yet the Church did appoint and doth obſerue this number of daies in their Lent-Faſt, with reſpect and reference to the like number of dayes that Chriſt faſted in the wilderneſſe.

<note n="(c)" place="margin">D. Field of the Church. l. 3. cap. 19. pag. 105, 106.</note> A reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and learned Writer in our own Church, hath deliuered the poynt in much more diſtinct maner. Hee ſaith three things. 1. That <hi>it is very fit, there be a ſolemne time, at leaſt once in the yeere, wherein men may call themſelues to an account for all their negligences, repent them of all their euill doings, and with Prayers, faſtings and mournings turne vnto the Lord.</hi> 2. That <hi>this time</hi> of the yeere <hi>was choſen as fitteſt, both becauſe that herein we remember the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt for our ſinnes, as alſo for that after this meditation of Chriſts ſufferings, his ioyfull Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection doth immediately preſent it ſelfe vnto vs in the dayes following, &amp;c.</hi> 3. That <hi>for the limitation of the number of dayes, men had an eye to Chriſts Faſt of <pb n="145" facs="tcp:21717:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>forty daies, as to a conuenient direction.</hi> His meaning is, that the Church vpon the former grounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appoint a number of dayes for this ſolemne ſeruice and worke of humiliation, did make choice of <hi>forty dayes,</hi> the rather becauſe Chriſt had faſted <hi>forty dayes</hi> for our ſakes. Neither is this without good ground and reaſon. For firſt, the very num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſame dayes might ſerue for a more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſion and remembrance of Chriſts Faſt for ourſakes. To which purpoſe God himſelfe ſaith in a like caſe, vnto the rebellious Iewes:
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Num. 14.34.</note> 
                  <hi>After the number of the dayes, in which ye ſearched the Land, euen forty dayes (each day for a yeere) ſhall ye beare your iniquities, euen forty yeeres.</hi> In which paſſage we may note three things. 1. That GOD did proportion the puniſhment to the ſinne, that it might carry the more liuely repreſentation of it. This I gather hence, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>After the number, &amp;c.</hi> for that implyeth, that God did regulate the puniſhment by the offence. 2. That this proportion betweene the ſinne and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, conſiſted in the paritie or equality of the ſame number obſerued in them both. 3. That though there was this proportion and likenes of the number, yet there was a diſproportion and vnlikenes in the matter of that number. For their ſinne was acted in <hi>fortie dayes,</hi> but their puniſhment was to be ſuffered for <hi>fortie yeeres:</hi> and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this diſſimilitude in the things num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, the likenes in the very number it ſelfe, did ſerue to keepe a freſh remembrance of the fact. And ſo in our Lent-Faſt, there is a great difference
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21717:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>betweene the manner of Chriſts Faſt, and of ours; becauſe hee faſted altogether without taſting any thing, which we can no way reach vnto; but doe come as farre ſhort of it, as <hi>forty dayes</hi> are ſhort of <hi>forty yeeres:</hi> yet in as much as we keepe the ſame number of dayes in our Faſt, that he kept in his; this very agreement in the number, may ſerue to repreſent vnto vs, and to keepe a remembrance of that Faſt of our Sauiour.</p>
               <p>And this may be one reaſon, why the Church might well make choyce of the ſame number of dayes for their yeerely and ſolemne Faſt, which our Lord had vſed before in his Faſt in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Church might iuſtly make choice of the ſame number of dayes that Chriſt faſted, becauſe the vſing of the ſame number might ſerue as a meanes to expreſſe our affection and loue to our Sauiour. For euen among men, children that deſire to honour the memory of their Fathers, will ſometimes ſay, I will doe this thing, or I will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that order, <hi>becauſe my Father or Grandfather</hi> was wont to doe ſo before me. And a kinde man after the death of his friend or benefactor, whom he doth reuerence and reſpect, will keepe ſome cuſtomes, and vſe ſome courſes, the rather becauſe it was the manner of that man, whom he doth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to doth ſo. And finally, all of vs vſe to ſay of them that be in loue, or doe tenderly affect one another; that they loue the very ground on which each of them doth tread. And all this ſheweth, that where there is loue and reſpect, there men doe <pb n="147" facs="tcp:21717:79"/>deſire to conforme themſelues in euery manner they may, to the actions and behauiour of thoſe, whom they doe affect and loue. And ſo in this caſe, the Church might ſhew loue and reſpect to her Redeemer, by making choice of that number of dayes for her Faſt, which hee had vſed in his. I may then, I hope, not without ground, ſay, that the Church did appoint <hi>fortie dayes</hi> for Lent-Faſt, with an eye to the <hi>forty dayes</hi> Faſt of our Sauiour; as willing, and that for good reaſon, to keepe the ſame number of dayes, that he had done.</p>
               <p>Now out of all this, we haue three Corollaries, which I will add for the concluſion of this whole point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Coroll.</hi> That our Church hath great reaſon to wiſh, as ſhe doth; that the old Diſcipline of Lent might be reſtored againe. For the thing in it ſelfe is very effectuall to purge ſinne, and worke amendment of life: and the time is very fitly choſen, to conforme vs to the ſufferings of Chriſt, and to fit vs for the celebrity of his Reſurrection: becauſe hauing purged out the <hi>old leuen</hi> of ſin, we may then <hi>keepe the feaſt with the vnleauened bread of ſyncerity and truth:</hi> yea and the very number of dayes, allotted for this ſeruice, is not without ſome good vſe to keepe the freſher remembrance of our Lords tentations and faſtings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Coroll.</hi> That they ouerſhoote themſelues in a miſ-gouerned zeale, who to croſſe the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of
<hi>Rome,</hi> do make theſe ancient faſting daies the vſual times of their feaſting. For in ſo doing, they doe not onely ſhew themſelues vnlike to the <pb n="148" facs="tcp:21717:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>ancient Chriſtians, whoſe example it is our glory to follow in their lawfull courſes; but they doe alſo without cauſe obliterate a good memoriall of their Sauiours mercies. I like their zeale in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging out of Popiſh ſuperſtition: but I ſhould like it better, if it were ioyned with moderation and wiſedome: ſuch for example ſake, as <hi>Ezekiah</hi> and the Prieſts did vſe in purging of the Temple. And that was this,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Chro. 29.16.</note> 
                  <hi>They brought out all the vncleannes, that they found in the Temple of the Lord, into the Court of the Houſe of the Lord: and the Leuites tooke it, to carry it out abroad into the brooke Kidron.</hi> And when they had thus cleanſed all the Houſe of the Lord, then
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Verſ. 21. &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>they brought bullocks,</hi> and <hi>rammes</hi> and <hi>Lambes</hi> and <hi>hee goates,</hi> and offered ſacrifices, and performed the wonted ſeruice to the Lord in his Temple. Where we ſee, they did not pull downe the Temple becauſe of the ſuperſtitions or abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations rather, with which
<hi>Ahaz</hi> and the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that time had defiled it: but they purged out the ſuperſtition, and kept the Temple ſtill for its wonted holy vſes. And ſo it were a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable zeale, if men would purge the ancient faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dayes of the Church, and carrie out the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions with which Popery hath defiled them, and caſt them into ſome riuer, or rather into ſome ſea, that they may neuer apeare any more in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world. But as it had beene too much violence then, to pull downe the Temple for the vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſake that was in it; ſo it is too much violence now, to aboliſh all times of faſting and humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the ſuperſtition that ſome men haue placed in them.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:21717:80"/>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Coroll.</hi> That while there is no publique or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for reſtoring the old Diſcipline, men ſhould doe well each one for himſelfe apart, to renew ſo much of it, as he may conueniently in his priuate practice. And if any mans eyther great infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or iuſt occaſions doe let him from ſo doing; (For infirmities of body, and occaſions of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary dueties haue euer beene diſpenſed with:) yet then hee ſhould in deſire follow after that, which indeed he cannot aſpire vnto; and by his inward humiliation &amp; repentance, labour to recompence what is wanting in his outward faſting and abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. And thus I haue done with this poynt of Lent; and conſequently haue by Gods mercy now finiſhed that which in the ſecond place I propoſed concerning our Sauiours faſting, and other things of our practice, occaſioned thereby.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing hitherto ſpoken of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours <hi>faſting;</hi> it remaineth to adde a word or two of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent thereof, which is his
<hi>hungring,</hi> and thereof the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt ſaith, <hi>Hee was afterward an hungred;</hi> which words may haue two ſenſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this, <hi>Hee was afterward an hungred;</hi> that is, he now firſt began to feel the want of meat, and nature began to craue ſome ſupply. And this interpretation implyeth, that for the whole ſpace of forty dayes, hee had no hunger, nor felt no want of meate, or no affliction of body for lacke of it: but that during that whole ſpace, the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did ſupport the humane nature, that his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heat did not worke vpon the nouriſhment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to natures courſe, as the
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Dan. 3.25.</note> fire of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace did not worke vpon the three men that were caſt into the middeſt of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the words may be expounded thus, <hi>Hee was afterward an hungred;</hi> that is, he was now pinched with hunger, and being not well able to endure any longer, did manifeſt his hunger by ſeeking after meate. And this interpretation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, that in the time of his forty dayes Faſt, he <pb n="151" facs="tcp:21717:81"/>felt ſome hunger, though not ſuch as afterward he did, nor ſuch but that he might endure it, and expect a longer time, before need made him to breake off his purpoſe of faſting. And this I take to be the fitter and more probable expoſition of the words.</p>
               <p>But which way ſoeuer wee take it, yet thus much is apparent by the Text, that at the end of forty dayes, Chriſt through long abſtinence was in ſome diſtreſſe for want of ſomething to refreſh nature, and yet had not ſo much as a piece of bread to ſatisfie his hunger, or to allay the crauing appetite of his ſtomach. For that our Lords hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in this place, was not ordinary, ſuch as a man when he hath faſted beyond his time may haue, and yet continue without any notable offence vnto nature: but rather that it was a pinching and a biting hunger, and ſuch as bred grieuance and moleſtation to nature, in a greater meaſure than is vſuall; may appeare by two things. Firſt, becauſe the Deuill tooke occaſion by this hunger, to tempt him with turning ſtones into bread: which had beene too ſilly a deuice for the old Serpent to vſe againſt our Sauiour, if hee had not ſeene him to bee in ſome extremity for want of food. Secondly, becauſe when the Deuill had done his tentation (for which Chriſt did make way by his hunger;) GOD ſent <hi>Angels</hi> from heauen to
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matt. 4.11.</note> 
                  <hi>miniſter vnto him;</hi> that is, to bring him meat for his refreſhing. Which kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence God doth not vſe to ſhew, but in caſes of extremity, and when ordinary meanes doe fayle <pb n="152" facs="tcp:21717:82"/>vs. The ſumme of all is, that Chriſt by his long abſtinence did endure extreme hunger, by which his body was afflicted, and nature was moleſted.</p>
               <p>And hence wee haue this note, that our Lord did for our ſakes ſubmit himſelfe to the afflictions and miſeries of this life. The Prophet calleth him
<note n="(b)" place="margin">Iſ. 53.3.</note> 
                  <hi>a man of ſorrowes, and acquainted with griefe.</hi> And the Euangeliſts doe ſhew, how his whole life was a Tragedie of many ſufferings. Hee was perſecuted from his cradle to his Croſſe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted from the wombe to the graue: but that which in this place wee are to take eſpeciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, is, the pinching hunger which hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly endured, becauſe it tended to the working of our Redemption, and the furthering of our ſaluation. To which purpoſe Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther note, that our Lord
<note n="(c)" place="margin">Ioh. 4.6.</note> 
                  <hi>being wearied with his iourney, ſate thus on Iacobs Well:</hi> And giueth vs withall to vnderſtand, that hee was both hungry and thirſty, when hee telleth vs, that

                  <hi>aske water of the woman to drinke.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding his preſent want of food at this time, hee refuſed to eate when it was brought him, becauſe he had a more neceſſary worke in hand, which he preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; that is,
<note n="(f)" place="margin">Verſ. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>to doe the will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his worke;</hi> implying in that ſpeech, the preaching of the Goſpel, and his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to ſaue the ſoules of men. And in this place, the extreme hunger that hee ſuffered, was for the preparing of himſelfe for his office, and <pb n="153" facs="tcp:21717:82"/>for the finiſhing of the worke of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus our Lord was contented to endure hunger and thirſt, and any thing, for the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and ſauing of our ſoules; ſo that as he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſaid of the Iewes, after hee had vſed all good meanes to worke grace in them,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iſai. 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>What could haue beene done more to my Vineyard, that I haue not done in it?</hi> ſo, conſidering his meane birth, and poore life, and bitter death, &amp;c. he may as truely ſay, <hi>What could I haue ſuffered more for my Church, which I haue not ſuffered for her?</hi> And now if any man periſh, it is his owne fault, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth ſo great ſaluation wrought by his Sauiour: and if any man be ſaued, it is Chriſts merits, who hath purchaſed ſo great Redemption for him, when he had deſerued damnation and death.</p>
               <p>And this may afford vs diuers good leſſons, at which I will onely poynt in this place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It teacheth vs, what a thankefull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance wee ſhould keepe of our Sauiours paynes for vs at all times. But eſpecially at this time of Lent, ordayned of purpoſe for a memoriall of Chriſts ſufferings, wee ſhould often meditate on our Sauiours great loue vnto vs, and conſider from poynt to poynt, how being Lord of all, hee made himſelfe the baſeſt of all, borne in a ſtable, lodged in a Manger, pinched with hunger, followed with contempt; accuſed, condemned, crucified and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombed in the earth for our ſakes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It yeeldeth vs comfort in all diſtreſſes. For the poore ſoule, when he is pinched with famine, may thus thinke with himſelfe;
<hi>My caſe is poore <pb n="154" facs="tcp:21717:83"/>and miſerable;</hi> but ſo was my Lord and Sauiours before mee: hee ſuffered greater hunger than this, and yet he had no bread to refreſh him; nor no eye of man to pitty him: but the onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and comfort that he had for the time, was the yelling of wilde beaſts about him, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and batteries of the Deuill againſt him. And the like meditation of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort may be drawne from other parts of Chriſts ſufferings, to cheare all them that be in like diſtreſſe. For if Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch great things without grudging, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may be content to indure leſſer things with patience and comfort.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It cryeth ſhame vpon our niceneſſe and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, who repine to endure any paynes, eyther for Chriſts ſake, or our owne. For if hee faſted ſo long, and hungred ſo much for vs; is it not much more reaſon, that when occaſion ſerueth, wee ſhould faſt for our ſelues? And yet ſee the difference. He faſted <hi>forty dayes and forty nights;</hi> and wee thinke it too much to faſt one day, without adding any night vnto it: hee faſted, till hee fainted; and we thinke it too much to faſt till we haue concocted the crudities of the former meale: hee faſted, when hunger pinched his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and moleſted nature, and yet would endure it ſtill, till hee had finiſhed the worke, which hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in his Faſt; &amp; we think it too much, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the leaſt paine, though the mortifying of our ſinnes doe require a great deale more. Nay Chriſt was betrayed &amp; apprehended &amp; condemned and crucified for our ſinnes; and wee thinke it too <pb n="155" facs="tcp:21717:83"/>much to paſſe theſe dayes of his ſufferings, in a ſad and mournefull remembrance of them. But wee ſhould learne to checke our dulneſſe, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with our Sauiours forwardneſſe and zeale. And hereunto wee may further adde, that if the Phyſician doe taſte of the potion which hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth, the Patient may be ſure that there is no poyſon in it: and ſo, ſeeing our Lord, the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian of our ſoules, hath drunke ſo deepe of this Cup of humiliation, wee may be ſure it is no way hurtfull to our ſoules. And therefore if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not equall him in faſting <hi>forty dayes;</hi> at leaſt let vs not repine to follow him in faſting at conuenient times: and as hee paſſed not for a pinching hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that he might worke our Redemption; ſo let not vs ſticke at a little hunger, that wee may attaine the ſaluation that hee hath purchaſed for vs.</p>

                              <p>OF thoſe things which dreine and euacuate the body through the vpper parts, ſome doe apparently prouoke ſweates, others digeſt vapours and thinne ſubſtance by breathing through the pores of the skin. In this kinde are contained Faſting, Anoynting, Rubbing: in that, Exerciſe, Bath, and Hot-houſes.</p>
                              <p>Faſting comes neereſt to blood-letting in force and vertue: waſting the blood by little and little, which blood-letting ſends foorth at once and on a ſudden. Beſides that, it ſcatters and ſpends the raw and many other humours, and driues foorth all kind of excrements. For, nature being free and not hindred, doth forthwith procure vs all things that are healthfull. Therefore, when the wonted meate is either in part or in whole withdrawne from the body, ſo that there is want of it; then our inbred heate (the author of all our naturall functions) which is diffuſed and ſpred through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all parts, being not encumbred by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of new meat, euery where exerciſing its <pb n="161" facs="tcp:21717:86"/>owne force, growes ſtrong. And firſt of all it changeth the profitable iuyce and blood into the ſubſtance of the body and the parts thereof, and conſumes it, by turning it into nouriſhment: but the thinne humours and the ſuperfluous it digeſts into vapours, and waſtes them inſenſibly: the raw humors it concocts, and changes into blood fit for nouriſhing the body: and of the ſuperfluous humors, the thicke ones it makes thinne, &amp; ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth away the ſlimy: and therefore it ſtrongly riddeth obſtructions. Moreouer, whatſoeuer it cannot concoct, that it prepares at leaſt; and it makes all the paſſages of the body, by which it ſhould be thruſt out, more open and ready. Then alſo the expulſiue faculty carries away whatſoeuer was prepared, into the paſſages of purging, and expels it out. Hereupon moſt commonly the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is looſened of its owne accord, vomitings burſt out, vrine is made in more abundance, excrements of the braine flowe downe: and that which is further off from the paſſages of purging, is conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by breathing through the pores of the skin. By theſe meanes, the whole body is eaſed, being disburdened as it were of its load, the breathing is made free and eaſie, the mind and all the ſences become more ready and cheerefull.</p>
                              <p>Faſting, while it workes theſe things in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt body, moſt commonly it fils the belly with ill humours: whence come gnawings of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, watchings, diſturbances of the body, and giddines or ſwimmings in the head: namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the naturall heate doth in the want of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment <pb n="162" facs="tcp:21717:87"/>exagitate the noxious humors, as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke doth. But thoſe diſturbed humours at laſt it ſubdues, tames, and driues out: whereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows great tranquillity, and aſſwaging of diſeaſes and many ſymptomes, naturall heate hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in his integrity and ſtrength.</p>
                              <p>Theſe things indeed doth moderate faſting ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, in that it whets the ſharpe humours, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames, and heates the body. But immoderate faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe both the nouriſhment and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous humour being ſpent, it waſtes alſo the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſtance of the parts, which is the ſeat of heat; at length it cooles the body, and diminiſhes and impaires the ſtrength. Seaſonable abſtinence is wholſome; and moſt profitable is that euacuation which is made by faſting. For it works gently, and without any violent forcing either of the body or the humors, and without bringing into the body any vnnaturall quality, it proceeds ſoftly and by degrees.</p>
                              <p>Furthermore, ſharp and violent diſeaſes can ſcarce ſafely be holpen by faſting alone: but the corrupt and putrified humour, which hath much degenerated from the naturall goodnes, &amp; which the inbred heate can neither any more reduce to its goodnes, nor ſuddenly driue it out, muſt bee preſently euacuated either by blood-letting, or purging. But light diſeaſes, that would riſe of crudities, ſparing dyet preuents: the ſame being newly bred, faſting eaſily cures: and when they become inueterate and old, it doth mitigate them by concoction, and at laſt driues them away. The <pb n="163" facs="tcp:21717:87"/>ſame faſting doth conueniently ſtop the diſeaſes that would come of fulnes: becauſe, by degrees and in proceſſe of time, it takes away the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance that burdens nature. But thoſe diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which now for the preſent doe rage by reaſon of fulnes, not faſting but blood-letting doth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily take away.</p>
                              <p>And beſides, in cruder and rawer diſeaſes, the place where the matter lyes is to bee conſidered. For, when eyther fulnes or crudity or flegme is burdenſome and troubleſome to the veines or the vpper parts, as to the head, then ſparing and dry dyet is good: with that moderation, that it may nouriſh the numbles and chiefe parts that they waſte not, and yet reach not ſo farre as to the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per parts of the body. But when the fault ſtickes either in the ventricle or in the firſt region of the body, a much more ſparing and dry dyet muſt be enioyned.</p>
                              <p>Faſting is called ſometimes Abſtinence, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time a ſparing not of meate only, but alſo of drink, which doth more and ſooner then meate fill both the bowels &amp; veynes, and finds them worke. Therfore doe thou cure by Phyſicke, thoſe diſeaſes, which faſting hath not taken away.</p>
